And the things we're drawn to,  because of its beauty,  turns into the most horrid of things.     Be careful,  to whom you judge,  you never know,  when someone might say the same things,  about you.     Beauty is only skin deep.  The soul,  is what will forever remain the same.     Our differences,  are what define us,  even through all the vanity. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The title pretty much says it all *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*This is total crack but: Dr Dolittle (or one of his decedents) arrives at Jurassic World. Probably before the movie. Maybe they're part of a team to check to make sure the dinosaurs are being treated well. Maybe they work there. Heck, maybe Barry's last name is actually Dolittle. (And he's constantly amazed how well Owen gets the raptors despite the fact they can't speak to each other). The point is, being a Dolittle means all animals sound like they're speaking English. But these are dinosaurs, so they sound like they're speaking old English.  Maybe the T-rex is speaking like Shakespeare or the Apatosaurus talk like something out of Pride &amp; Prejudice. I have this really bizarre image of the raptors talking like pirates &amp; calling Owen captain.  This is utter crack and, as I can in no way write accents or dialects, I'm never going to write this. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Fic idea I got from a dream I had (Thought of before Legend of Kora came out) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*What if Sozin died with Roku (or maybe instead of).  They’d be no war so what would the characters be doing? Aang would probably still have run away but with less consequences. Katara would have had waterbenders to learn from in the south pole. It’s doubtful Ozai would be fire lord but would he be as bad as he was? And it’s very doubtful Toph’s life have changed at all.  I had a vague idea of there being some sort of evil organisation working in the shadows of all four nations (maybe started by Sozin) kind of like an evil order of the white lotus. Of course I can’t think of what else to do with it so it on the stories-I’ll-never-write pile. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*I like crossovers. I'm pretty sure I'm dating when I thought of this idea just by what shows/books I mention here *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*A Stargate team (SG13 might be a little cliché but lets go with it) finds out their members are a little unusual.   This is just basically an excuse to have a big crossover fic. I thought of it when I was reading a Xander joins the SGC story. So Xander (Buffy the Vampire Slaver) joins the SGC (Stargate SG1) sometime after graduation maybe. And on his team are a mutant (X-men) a witch/wizard (Harry Potter) an immortal (Highlander) and anyone else I can think of. I kind of wanted it to be with side characters or even original ones but I could never think of any situations for them to get in. No plot means no story so this remains on my never-going-to-write pile. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*David Xanatos from Gargoyles, Lex Luther from smallville(or wherever), Seto Kaiba from Yugioh, Tony Stark from the Iron man movies and Bruce Wane from either the Nolan movies or the animated series (and any other rich character from a fandom I can remember) are all a some high class party, all secretly bored out of their minds. Then some high tech thieves try to crash the party to rob/kidnap the people there. Cue the assembled heroes and villains to fight off the intruders while not letting on to the other guests their combined badassery.   This would be a good excuse for all sorts of shenanigans but I'm coming up blank when I try to think of details.  I’ll never write this not only because I don’t have an ending or even a plot but also because I don’t think I could actually write any of these characters convincingly. *~*TEXT*~*

The preacher smiled before he nodded. ''Reverend Amos Howell.''  There was something about Reverend Amos Howell that caused Kara to tense. She viewed a smile stretching. Revealing long teeth. She stepped back.  ''You're far from home?'' Reverend Amos Howell wished to know. Kara's grave was also going to be far from home.    THE END *~*TEXT*~*

Reverend Amos Howell smiled and nodded at Kara. He viewed her sitting.  Kara heard a strong accent. Southern? Kara struggled to remain awake as Reverend Amos Howell preached.

*~*TEXT*~*I never created Batman TAS.            The Sewer King scowled and trembled at the same time. He focused on a pet alligator's grave marker. Although the alligator lived a long life, its grave marker caused him to suffer. The Sewer King remembered his tears and every sob after the alligator never woke up recently. Hands formed fists at either side of his body. *At least you won't suffer again. You won't. You won't.* The Sewer King shrugged. *You're not far. The grave is a bit close to my throne under the streets* he thought. One corner of the Sewer King's mouth ascended. At least it tried to ascend. There wasn't a smile. Perhaps never again. Eyes widened as soon as the alligator's spirit faded into view. The Sewer King stepped back slowly. He began to blink after the spirit's tail wagged. A new smile materialized. Tears streamed down the Sewer King's face. He nodded. ''I understand.'' The spirit vanished. It was always going to be happy and never far from the Sewer King.   THE END *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The Sewer King began to smile after he ate a chocolate bar. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*I never created Batman TAS.   The Sewer King began to smile after he ate a chocolate bar. It was a good evening so far. He was near four pet alligators and scratched their snouts recently. The Sewer King remembered sending his children to steal lots and lots of pretties a few hours ago. A rare smile near his children as soon as they returned with several valuables. The other memory?  Children weren't always able to return with lots and lots of pretties for their king. The streets of Gotham City were barren sometimes. Barren just like pockets they tried to pick. Barren just like their hands after they returned to the Sewer King.  At least children were able to steal chocolate recently. The Sewer King's smile remained before he began to rest near alligators. He watched as they imitated him. His head was on one alligator's back. He was on one side of his body. His eyes widened.  A memory of children returning with empty hands formed again. One new scowl appeared on his face. The Sewer King couldn't rest for the remainder of the evening. Even while he was with pets.   THE END *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*I don't own Batman TAS characters.     ''You lived a long life,'' the Sewer King said as he frowned. He focused on a grave marker under the streets. A memory formed. A memory of remaining with a pet alligator recently. One previous scowl. His tears prior to the alligator shutting its eyes and never opening them due to old age.  The Sewer King revealed new tears near the grave marker. He struggled to smile. ''I remember being with you after entering the sewer a few months ago. I recall you protecting me from others wishing to harm me. Perhaps end my life. At least you don't care if I pick pockets to survive. We're destined to remain under the streets.''  The Sewer King recalled feeding the pet alligator bits of chicken occasionally. One gentle laugh as he scratched its snout. As the alligator's tail wagged. The Sewer King also remembered a different laugh while the alligator licked his face.  One alligator's grave was always going to be under the streets. The Sewer King remained under the streets. He began to sob and reveal tears under the streets.    THE END *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Everything in Xander's life is finally falling into place. He's got an amazing husband and the perfect baby girl. Nothing will ever feel better than this. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*At the end of another long day, Mitch and Xander crawled into bed but it wasn't long before both men were awakened by the cries of their baby daughter. Feeling the bed dip with the shift of weight, Mitch gently pushes his husband back onto the bed.  “Go back to sleep, babe. I'll go take care of her.”, Mitch murmurs before leaning in to kiss Xander's temple. Once up and out of bed, he makes his way into their daughter's room and picks her up out of her crib.  “Hey pretty girl. Daddy's here.”, he murmurs, kissing her tiny cheek. Setting her on the changing table, he gets her into a clean diaper. Once she's all clean, he picks her back up and heads into the kitchen to make her a bottle.  After she's fed, Mitch puts her back to bed before heading back into the bedroom. Crawling under the covers, he wraps his arms around Xander's waist and pulls him close, kissing his forehead. “Love you, Mitch.”, Xander mumbles, voice thick with sleep. “Love you too, Xan.”, he murmurs before drifting off to sleep. *~*TEXT*~*

But I can’t eat them ☹ It’s just not fair.” Virgil looked over at Patton as his lower lip quivered as he stared at the pods and wondered;  How did he just verbalise a frowny face???  “You can eat them once.” said Logan flatly. “Wha-  really ?!?” “Only once. Because you won’t be around for a second time.” “Huh?” said Patton confused. Virgil’s eyes widened; “Logan no!  Savage! ” and he quickly snatched all the tide pods off the table out of Patton’s reach. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*A soft piano melody flows within the simple white room, echoing off the walls and encompassing the area with a calming background noise. Two individuals have taken residence, the red haired bookman jr, Lavi enjoying the calm with a novel, embracing his white haired companion Allen, who has taken residence at the radiant white piano in the center of the room.  After a recent mission had gone out of hand, with the arrival of a horde of level three akuma, both exorcists had been forced to rest and allow their injuries to heal. So, this day had been designated as a “lazy day,” with the two exorcists simply enjoying eachothers company without the stress of any other day. A lazy day with no akuma, no central, no link, and no missions. Just one another. Both exorcists were perfectly happy that way. “You promise you’ll stay with me?” *~*TEXT*~*

"Scary movies are for chumps. Scary movies are for chumps. Scary movies are for chumps." Ron muttered his breath for the eighth time as took a sneak glance from his position. The blond was currently halfway into Josh's lap, face buried in his shoulder jumping at everything.  "I'll tell you when it's over babe. Just relax."  "I'm not scared! I'm Ron Stoppable--ahhhh!"

*~*TEXT*~*Ray stood in front of the sink and was elbow deep in warm, soapy water. He didn’t usually do the dishes, but sometimes he had the urge to clean. He picked up Fraser’s small ass teacup and smiled as he washed the white porcelain.  He used to feel like a real zero. He had lost his parents and then Stella divorced him. He took the Vecchio gig because being anyone else was better than being himself. He was a real loser.  Then he met Fraser.   As first he thought Fraser was a freak, but as he got to know him, he realized that Fraser was just different. They were both different and the worked like a finely tuned engine.  He hadn’t known who he would be without Fraser, but he knew he was better with Fraser.  Speaking of Fraser, he came up behind Ray and wrapped his arms around Ray’s waist. Ray grinned as Fraser’s lips brushed his neck.  He no longer felt like a loser or a zero, but he was a winner and a ten.  Fraser understood him and he understood Fraser in way that always made Ray smile.  He would never understand Fraser’s obsession with curling though. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Are you okay?” Ginny asked in a panic as she kneeled down next to Luna. She had come to watch Ginny’s Quidditch practice, as the supportive girlfriend often did. Unfortunately, she had been struck by a rogue bludger.  “I’m not as fragile as you think I am,” Luna answered softly. Her blue eyes twinkled humoriously at Ginny. Ginny knew her girlfriend was right. She had faced the same horrors Ginny did in the previous year. Still, she couldn’t help but think of her as delicate. Bouncy blonde, fair, and skinny. A voice light and dreamy. Her mannerisms were certainly delicate, as were the colors of her favourite dresses.  Yes, Luna was delicate. But she was also tough. She wasted little time on fear and worry. She held her beliefs close to her heart. She could take a Bludger to the head like a pro Quidditch player. “I know,” Ginny replied. She stood, offering a hand to Luna  “Let’s go to Madame Pomfrey and see if that ball knocked some sense into you.” Luna giggled at the redhead’s quip before gripping her hand and standing up.

*~*TEXT*~*"So, I understood the weapon and the dress and even the fruit but... Sif, you do know that nobody on Earth accepts gold coins as currency, right?"   Sif smiled at Jane.   "An, but I shall not need to provide for you on Midgard. Your work will support us."   Jane frowned.   "That's... an incredibly nice sentiment but... Sif, my work is in experimental astrophysics. It doesn't... exactly pay well."   "It will, once it is recognised by your peers."   Jane's frown deepened.   "That might be a while."   Sif clapped a hand on her arm.   "Then I shall simply have to find work." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Here.”  Grantaire looked up to see one of his coworkers offering him a hot cup from the café. “I can’t have coffee,” he said, gesturing to his belly.  She smiled, gesturing to her own. “Same. It’s hot chocolate. With peanut butter.”  Grantaire’s eyes went wide and he grabbed it - a little too fast. "I have been craving this all day."  The woman sat down next to him. “I heard your… boyfriend?”  “Husband.”  She nodded. “I heard your husband and you talking about it. I’ve been craving fries myself.”  Grantaire groaned.  She laughed. “Go out after work?”  “Sure,” Grantaire said.  “Musichetta.”  “R.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Faye doesn't do 'friends'.   Written for the 100 Fandoms Challenge, #005 Away. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Faye is used to making an escape. Attachments are dangerous and after everything that’s happened, she’s trained herself to be able to just  go.  It’s for her own protection—because sure as hell no one  else  is going to protect her.     Spike, Ed, Jet, and Ein – she should be able to leave them behind just as easily. But for some reason they grow on her worse than the mould at the back of that damn fridge. It’s hard to admit that, for once, she doesn’t want to run away.     And by the time she can admit it, she’s lost them. *~*TEXT*~*

Trial and error had proven that was the best place for him when doing housework. “Yes,” he said solemnly. “It is my professional opinion as a real estate agent that rocket ships improve any house.”  Joly giggled, then cleared his throat and nodded. “It’s true. Rocket ships are awesome, therefore they improve the health of those around them. That’s my professional opinion as a med student. Hand me the next sheet?”  Chetta laughed and passed up the wallpaper. “Of course.” *~*TEXT*~*

Eponine looked down at her hands. “I need… help. I want to get custody of Gavroche.”  Bahorel grinned and patted her knee, sitting down next to her. “I think I know some people who will help.” *~*TEXT*~*

Jehan smiled softly and walked over, draping a blanket around his shoulders before perching on the bed opposite him. “You made that.”  Grantaire smiled and glanced over at his sleeping daughter. “I did make that.”  “Ferre’s really happy.”  The noise of the party outside drifted in.  Grantaire chuckled, stretching his arms under the blanket. “Well, he did help.”  Jehan smiled and glanced over at the baby, a strange expression on their face.  “Do you want one?” Grantaire asked softly.  Jehan shrugged. “I don’t know. Our house is barely big enough for the two of us, anyway.”  Grantaire nodded and turned back to stare at his baby again.  “She’s beautiful,” Jehan said. *~*TEXT*~*

He tries to not think of mother, sitting in the living room, smoking and drinking with her TV dinner untouched as she scribbles away on paperwork.  He doesn’t know what to say, but he feels his face burn when he answers, “I like everything.” *~*TEXT*~*

Just felt like it.”  Ema smiles, and kisses Kay back. “Well, so did I.”  Kay laughs, until Mr Edgeworth comes over.  “Would you two refrain from kissing for five minutes, please?”  “Oh, don’t be so prudish, Mr Edgeworth,” Kay says.  “I am not being a prude. I just find it inappropriate to kiss at a crime scene.”  Kay looks around, and remembers that they stand at the sight of a murder, about to test for luminol reaction. “Oh yeah.”  Ema grins, still bright red. “Oh yeah.”  Mr Edgeworth raises his eyebrows. “Honestly.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Shyness or modesty that is intended to be alluring. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Hobbits, by nature, are very modest people. Most of the time. Usually. A few are terribly boastful, but when compared to other races hobbits are the epitome of modesty. This may be why Thorin thought that Bilbo was just being coy when he attempted to boast about the hobbit in Laketown. It’s usually bad form when someone boasts about you to immediately try to be modest about it. To say that it was chance, or accidental, or something anyone one would have done.  Either way, Thorin Oakenshield, who already liked Bilbo, just found this beautifully modest hobbit the best thing.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*This is going to be a series of short sories based around the most well-known/well-accepted ships in Steven Universe. I will warn you that, so far, I have only seen 1 and 1/2 seasons and this will probably terribly innacurate and very very bad but, we'll see how it goes. I've heard a lot of people asking for fics in the SU fandom that dont include smut/character death/spoilers. I will not be including any of these because, i cant write smut, deaths will make me sad and i know barely enough to give away spoilers.  The only "spoilers" that i am aware of that will possibly be mentioned/influence these fics are:  SPOILER WARNING: -Garnet is the fusion of Ruby and Sapphire (though i'm pretty certain everyone knows that because its in season 1.) -Rose quarts IS Pink diamond     If you still want to read this (for some reason) then, please, enjoy :) *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Tasha tucked herself back in between Deanna's legs without much of a warning and leaned back, trusting her girlfriend to catch her. Deanna cradled her head and started running soft fingers through her hair. She didn't have much hair, of course, but it felt wonderful all the same. Deanna was quite good with her hands. She was also quite good with feelings. “Do you want to talk about it?” she offered, gently enough that the end of silence did not jolt Tasha back up into hyper awareness. “Not yet,” Tasha murmured, sinking deeper into Deanna's body and resting there, warm and safe. Deanna did not stop her tender ministrations. “Alright.” Tasha breathed out easily. It had taken her a while to realize Deanna honestly would respect all her boundaries, without anything having to be explained. It was just one of the reasons she loved her so much, one of the reasons they worked so well together.  “I love you.” She could hear the smile in Deanna's voice when she replied, “I know.” Tasha would roll her eyes if she weren't so comfortable. “I love you too.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Oh for the brightness of gentle rays of light,  Burning honey light - waning when the moon turns - shimmering over deft horizon,  Yet memory prevails in sentimental sugar; nectar of affection as the glistening touch of sunlight wains upon my palid flesh,  But love; soft, generous love, has bled into my veins  For but my adoring - lithe; cautious in its feather-gentle caresses - sentiment, The glaze of love my heart dispenses, as lambs calmly slumber,  And the trill of a harp rings above...  Oh! But for my breast and the ache. The impending dread, For when my sunbeam, my ray of goodness, my all-consuming heatwave... Is snatched from me by the endlessness of any immortal... *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*In the darkness and in the loneliness that surrounds her, Cersei realizes that Jaime has let go of her hand.  He’s gone . He won’t come back to her ever again.  She can feel a  pain  expand in the center of her chest, making its way into her like a snake intent on poisoning every other part of her. She opens her mouth,  she represses a sob  and she closes her mouth, while a grimace of suffering contorts her lips in agony.  She recollects herself,  forcing herself  to do it.  She stands still so  proudly , like the fierce, cruel and brave lioness she is.  Alone . *~*TEXT*~*

Miku paused and smiled. "I think she's still getting the hang of the software, but once she does... At least I'll have more than a line to go on. I wonder what sort of work she does that she wants me to sing about it." Meiko shrugged and went back to the magazine she was reading. "La La La, twist and sway, working all day..." "It's not actually that catchy," Meiko interrupted, flatly. Miku shrugged. "It's sort of grown on me. It has potential." Meiko sighed. And tried to go back to her magazine. They were both singing it by the time the twins and Kaito arrived home. And they were all hoping the songwriter would get back and add some new lyrics about two hours after that. But the housework was done for once. Meiko supposed that was... "La La La..." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*John finished arranging his armband and tie. He made sure he had everything necessary with him. He left the room and walked down the aisle and reached the door at the end. He took a deep breath, took the door handle and opened the door, and before anything, he reached the pistol in his left side and pointed it immediately. Without doubt he pulled the trigger; a bulled travelled a straight path to its target. It hit its mark without problem, and the blood and brains of Juliana Crane where all over the wall with her motionless body lied on the floor. John woke up and opened his eyes. He had a big smile on his face. He left the bed and took a shower. He was finishing to dress up, and while looking at the mirror he said: -What a wonderful dream. He left the house and while closing the door he was thinking on the reality now. It would not be a simple bullet, but a great explosion into oblivion. This was going to be a great day. *~*TEXT*~*

She eased into his touch, humming, playing with the locks at his nape. His thumb stroked the soft dip of her hip over the layers of fabric.  "You were saying?"  Cassian could  hear  the smile in the insolent ring of her voice. Turning into nothing but thumping heart and tingling skin, he smiled against Jyn's lips. His exhale became her inhale. She tilted her head and her demanding lips recaptured his. Cassian melted into the kiss, his fingers sliding into her hair— He could stay like this forever, melting into her.  His comm beeped. Their bubble popped.  "Later."  She squeezed his hand on her way out.  *~*TEXT*~*

I love you. I love you,” he replied, moving his lips down from Seokmin’s forehead, peppering more kisses along the side of his face to finally connect them with his lips. The pair both leaned back and stared into profound eyes, completely captivated by the other’s gaze. This moment felt like forever. They were so in love. And  nothing  was going to change that.   Seokmin jolted awake and looked over to his best friend, laying on the bed across from him. His heart sank. He let out a heavy sigh. Maybe one day... *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He knows he shouldn’t have taken it, but he couldn’t resist. Mary doesn’t wear most of the makeup in her bag, as far as he can tell, and she definitely never wears the bold red lipstick he’s spreading on his lips now.  “Jack?”  He startles, dropping the lipstick. It clatters against the porcelain of the sink, leaving a red smear down the side.  “Sorry,” Sam says quietly. “I didn’t mean to scare you. I knocked.”  Jack ducks his head away, as if hiding will take back what Sam’s seen. “I didn’t hear.”  “That’s okay.” Sam’s voice is soothing and the strong hand that settles on Jack’s shoulder is equally so. “What are you doing?”  His stomach clenches nervously. “I... um...”  Sam glances down at the lipstick in the sink and the little plastic bag over other makeup on the counter. Jack’s only really messed with the foundation and lipstick so far.  “Where did you get those?” Sam asks, thumb rubbing slow circles on Jack’s shoulder.  “... stole them from Mary,” Jack whispers.  Sam nods and gives Jack’s shoulder a squeeze. “Put them back and we’ll run to the store. Get you some of your own.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"I love Shiro and Curtis but they could've been better portrayed," someone complains, and Curtis thinks that never would have happened because he's just a pawn in someone's game.  How can anyone love something that's so transparent?  Curtis wonders how anyone could love him. He's nothing but a shadow of a character, an insult to everyone and everything that matters. He's a husk, a worthless attempt at pandering, and he's got no excuses. He knows why he exists, why the Coalition made him what he is, but he doesn't have enough agency to scream the truth. He's just the guy in the background who got married off to the gay guy in hopes of getting to Coalition a prize.  No one should care about him. No one should give him the time of day.  He's not even human.  Shiro deserves better than someone without a soul. *~*TEXT*~*

He is thankful for the darkness concealing the blush he can feel spreading across his face, although he reasons Data will no doubt have sensed the rise in his skin temperature anyway. “And perhaps we could—uh—use the time to explore  exactly  the lengths your creator went to in making you appear human?” Bashir deliberately bumps his hip against Data’s crotch as he hops down from the edge of the console. *~*TEXT*~*

A physical, traumatized reaction. Rumpelstiltskin had always been good about instilling fear in his teachings.  "… Of course, dearie."  A loud, colorful whirl of magical smoke. He's gone.  Or at least for the time being.  Well… at least now something's going right… Regina huffs, wiping again absently at her forehead. Blood trickles heavily from the Evil Queen's hairline. She only stares wordlessly, confounded at Regina who sighs and pull out a handkerchief from her dark gray blazer's pocket, dabbing and smearing crimson fluid.  "You're an idiot." Regina doesn't feel sorry for blurting this out, gazing over the Evil Queen's face as this mirror-like image begins to smile hesitantly. A person who looks so much like her. "Even if you're  me ."  "We  do  look good in red," the Evil Queen quips, smudging a bit of red on the pucker of Regina's lips.  *    *~*TEXT*~*

Except she hadn’t recovered memories from past lives yet. One night, Tamsin met a woman and desired something she couldn’t quite pinpoint.  But her body knew.  She felt a thrill inside.  It spread down her stomach to the space between her legs.  She felt herself getting wet, and gasped.  It was the first time that had happened, except once she experienced the sensation, she realized it wasn’t new at all.  Tamsin didn’t recall how to kiss.  She let the woman take control.  As Tamsin melted into their embrace, flashes of her past first kisses played across her mind like a movie.   When the movie played again in her next life, Tamsin would remember tonight’s first kiss as one of the best. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Prompt: Character A and B go clothes shopping.  Jeremy is a little stressed about an upcoming presentation. Brooke helps as best she can. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*            Jeremy hates clothes shopping.              Objectively, it’s one of the worst things in the world, next to public speaking. And guess who has a presentation next week?              Not only is it worth a quarter of his final grade, not only does the teacher not like him, but the presentation also comes with a “professional attire” requirement. And when Brooke saw him lay out a wrinkly, ill-fitting button-down shirt, needless to say, she flipped her lid.              Jeremy is so grateful to her for this. He really is. But after having to drive a half an hour to the nearest mall, getting caught in traffic, and then being herded into a stuffy mall, he’s feeling very, very cranky.              “Jeremy, you need a nap,” his Squip informs him, which Jeremy responds to by telling him to shut up.              He can muscle through a few hours of being at the mall if it means getting a good grade on his presentation. If it means making Brooke happy.              Brooke holds a shirt up against his shoulders.              “Aww, you look so handsome!” Brooke coos, brushing his bangs from his forehead.              He preens under the attention.              Yeah, he can do this. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Shinooka is dating her team’s coach, but the relationship is a well guarded secret.  [Kiss 13: Discreetly] *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Shinooka, the manager of the boys’ baseball team, is proud to say she has a girlfriend. However, she wouldn’t actually tell you who her girlfriend is, because their relationship is a secret.  You see, her girlfriend is Momoe, the coach of her team. Which means their relationship comes with a big age gap and a power imbalance and is skirting the boundaries of whether it is illegal or not. Even if it is illegal, she doesn’t care. She loves Momoe, and she never wants to leave her.  So she can’t tell people who she is dating, even if she wanted to. And this means that whenever they kiss, they have to make sure that nobody can see them.  Which means whenever they’re getting out the equipment before baseball practise and happen to find themselves alone, Shinooka reaches up and gives her girlfriend a discreet kiss.  Yeah, this relationship is definitely problematic, but Shinooka doesn’t care. She just wants to experience this for as long as she can.  She never wants this to end. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Tib sighed as he finished changing Eli’s bandages which earned a wince from his idiot of a bodyguard. “I’m sorry, I thought things were going great.” Tiberius said as he checked over a cut on Eli’s cheek, scowling slightly. “There were none of the signs of an ambush or anything.”.  “We were dealing with a Sith Lord.” Old Man Reau remarked from his spot where he was treating Pre, not too gently either which earned a wince from Tib’s older half-brother. “Next time when I say not to deal with Force-users, you better fucking listen. You have a brain, use it.”.  “But…..”.  “I didn’t raise you to act before you fucking think.” Reau snapped back with a scowl. “Why do you think some of the warriors listen to Tiberius and Bo-Katan?”.  Tib’s attention was dragged away from the bickering pair as Eli shifted a bit. “You were right.” Eli pointed out.  “No more trusting Sith Lords.” Tiberius said with a smirk which earned a nod. *~*TEXT*~*

"You don't even work somewhere dangerous and that burn is the size of half a dinner plate!”  "Sorry, ser" Pavel Chekov replied guiltily, trying not to wince from the pain of his injury, despite the fact that the doctor was being as gentle as possible. Bones was mainly all bark and no bite, unless you really got him angry. Thankfully though, he had a soft spot for the young Russian navigator.   “Never mind. Just…don't handle anything hot.”  Seeing the horrified look on the boy's face, he added “except your boyfriend. Handle him any way you like.”  His face brightened, and Bones found himself smiling back in spite of everything.   “Now go. And be careful next time.”  “I will, ser!”  Bones opened his mouth to add something more, but the boy was already running out of medbay, clearly excited about something. Shaking his head, Bones went back to his files with a soft smile playing on his lips.     *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*That last night... *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*If they only had the one night, there was no room for hesitation or doubt, no time for regret or worry. They had only this - Kai's fingers in Sei's hair, his lips on Sei's neck, his body pressed close in the greatest of need. Somehow they got to Sei's bed - in hindsight Sei was sure they should have fallen over something and maybe they did but he just hadn't brought himself to care or commit it to memory. Not in the way he was memorizing Kai's bold touches, little noises, and sheer hunger. Sei vowed not to forget a second of it, even when they got to parts that turned out gleefully awkward and ended in laughter - Sei certainly hadn't prepared to have anybody over and in his bed, after all. One night... and they more than made the most of it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Ezra was caught off guard when Aria knocked on his door for the very first time. He rarely had visitors, and his apartment was a dreadful mess.  He didn't answer, but watched her through the peephole. A vantage point he appreciated.   She waited. Preened her hair. Nervously looked around.  Eventually she left, and he relaxed.  Ezra poured himself a glass of scotch, and resumed admiring the walls plastered with newspaper clippings, typewritten prose, and fleshly photos of Alison DiLaurentis. If Aria ever were to discover his little obsession with her dead best friend...   He'd probably have to kill her, too. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The saddest thing about betrayal, is that it never comes from your enemies. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*I once had a friend,  someone I thought I knew.     We played together often,  and spoke only truth.     The relationship I sought,  was meant as something pure.     A personal connection,  with another living being.     But the friendship I'd adored,  was nothing more than a simple illusion.     After a lot of critical thinking,  and past years of heartbreak,  I'd opened myself up once again,   optimistic  about this new friendship.     Seemingly,  I've been mistaken once again.  Setup behind my back,  sneaking about within the shadows.     The person I'd trusted,  made me out to be a fool.     Everything I once held dear,  snatched away within the time frame of an instance.     The sting of betrayal,  pricking at my heart,  making my chest tighten in anger,  sorrow filled tears pouring down,  voice unable to scream out.     Soul shattering,  beyond human comprehension.  What they've done to me,  I'd of   NEVER   done to them.     Because in my mind,  A true friend,  would never cause such hurt.     That kind of betrayal,  couldn't be more vile. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Daniel was saying something about work -- budget perhaps? -- but Peggy wasn’t listening.  She was watching his hands. Before, his hands were just that: hands. She paid them no mind. But now those hands meant so much to her. They wrapped around her own hands, warming her, comforting her. They curved around her waist, pulling her close until their bodies touched. They slid over her skin, exploring everywhere, arousing her with the slightest of strokes. “Peg? Are you okay?” She blinked, looking up at him. “Of course,” she said automatically, eyes focusing on his face, thoughts still lingering on those hands. *~*TEXT*~*

He is not the fire, he is the fire’s feast, an endless supply on which to feed on, to burn, to consume.     Father, sons, jewels, safety. Taken, lost, threatened, dead.     And the Valar, the untrustworthy Valar, don’t they know, don’t they  understand?  He  needs  the Silmarilli, needs their light, needs their strength. When they’re gone he’s unsettled, as though the best part of himself is gone and lost, howling for him in the Darkness.     Father, sons, safety, light. All gone, all lost. Only his Silmarils calling for him from across the sea. *~*TEXT*~*

James is a bad boy, Lily's favorite colour is floral (I think that sums her up), Al is a mystery as to how he got into Slytherin, and I never base my characters in the Cursed Child. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Sobriety hasn’t been kind to Klaus.     He’s been fleeing the feeling for hours. A groan that quickly scratches into a scream leaves him, the last of his soul, shivering out of his lungs. He can barely remember why he was like this. His skin is wet and shiny, like a precious stone, he thinks, dazed, to match the ones hanging between his legs.     He giggles, because why not?  It’s a hiccuping thing, pitiful. The empty and parasitic, comedic charm of a spent junkie. There’s nothing even remotely funny to laugh about. He feels the aching down to his bones. His head hurt, so bad.     Cold turkey can kill, you know.     He ignores that. Focuses on something else.     What else is there? There’s nothing but this.     “No one— no one wants to even listen to you right now,” he finds himself saying, slurring every word and tripping pathetically over the syllables. Tripping. Falling. Only this time, there was no chance of breaking his jaw. He had his voice. Only him.     It’s just you, Klaus.     “Right, right.” *~*TEXT*~*

That thing was still somewhat human. Human insides begging, pleading for me to stop:  "Oh God! It hurts! Please God, no! It hurts! You're going to kill me!" It pathetically whimpers and mewls. It keeps growing. Clinging to the walls like A parasitic lichen. I remove "it"  Him  Little by little  Day by day  Until he was finally down from that wretched mass of pulsing flesh  But he has gone silent.  Still.

*~*SUMMARY*~*Suzaku has so many questions for Lelouch.   (Lelouch of the Re;surrection spoilers.) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*When Suzaku reaches out to touch Lelouch’s cheek, his skin is warm. So many questions run through his mind — how is he alive? When did he come back? — and, at first, the words stick in his throat.  He looks just like he remembers him; from the Zero Requiem, and even before that. Suzaku wonders if he himself has changed much — if the pain and stress of losing Lelouch and taking the mantle of Zero has made him unrecognizable.  Back when they both went to school together, Suzaku would kiss him until their lips ached. It seems so long ago now, but Lelouch’s lips still look the same. If he moved just a bit closer — if he tilted his head just a fraction — he could relive those memories.  But the Lelouch he once knew and loved is gone, and as painful as that thought is, there is some relief in the closure. *~*TEXT*~*

Her laugh always had a tinge of wickedness to it—Adora knew this even before she knew what good and bad were, and before she had good and bad readjusted after meeting Glimmer and Bow and the Princesses.  It really only confirmed that Catra was Trouble, but it didn’t make Adora miss her any less.  Her laugh had changed, now, Adora realized, whenever they met again. Catra had tried to make her laughter different: tougher, deeper, more   ha-ha . Adora still knew her laugh. She still knew it was her.  Catra still squeaked. That was what hurt the most: she still sounded like she did when they were little. It reminded Adora that Catra   was  still a lost little girl, in many ways. Had she always been lost? What they had...was it ever real, or had it always been part of Catra’s wicked games?  “I miss you, Catra. Please, come back to me. We can be on the same side again, just you and me,” Adora begged. “Like old times.”  And Catra would just laugh. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Hickey finds in Gibson a somewhat-too-willing teacher. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*There are affinities among the Terror-men -- left to their own devices the Hartnell brothers cleave to one another, as do Genge and Honey, as do Diggle and Goddard, all the plump-cheeked Marines flocking together like so many red hens. In Gibson he has found a friend.  Two men can puff on the same pipe without remark -- Gibson's fingers graze his own as he packs the bowl and strikes the match, as if Billy isn't certain he knows how to handle himself. He might not know how to tie a sheet bend or dowse a sail, but he's not that green; he's never given himself to senseless waste.  His mother smoked a pipe like this, white wood with a snubbed handle -- puffing away with her needlework in front of her while someone else sweated out their keep in the next room, and waiting for her turn. Happy hours in the cradle. How many men remember their infancy? Gibson's lean leg bumps against his own under the table. The bitten stem is warm from his lip; the fire bites at Hickey's tongue. A fat pinch of tobacco, a measure of lemon juice, and thee, Billy Gibson -- what man would ask for more? *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*  You weren’t sure  why  Meg dragged you to the expensive ski lodge with her and her family, but at the promise of an all-expenses-paid vacation, you couldn’t find it in you to refuse. You’d grumbled at the sight of all the well-off people and their name brand  everything , but your best friend just dragged you closer to the front desk, checking in and asking about about the ski instructor she’d requested. “I thought you already knew how to ski?” She rolled her eyes, “Not for me. For you, dummy.” “No.  No   way, Meg.  You are NOT getting me to fly down some hill on a pair or toothpicks. I said I’d come, but I never agreed to any skiing.” She pouted, looking over your shoulder. “Well that’s such a shame. I already booked the lesson. And with such a cute instructor, too.” You followed her line of sight, taking in the man in a bright red puffy vest and khakis, his hair peeking out of his sporty beanie in soft brown tufts. He smiled at you, all perfect white teeth and killer green eyes. Okay, so  maybe  learning to ski wouldn’t be so bad. *~*TEXT*~*

Evelyn wouldn’t have minded, but the suggestive banter and the flirtatious touches were starting to make him react more physically and it would be hard to get through an evening with the Crawleys with Thomas providing such a distraction.  Thomas brushed past Evelyn, carrying a tray of drinks. As his backside brushed against Evelyn’s front. Evelyn gave Thomas’ hip a quick squeeze.  “Hands off what you can’t afford, Mr Napier.” Thomas smirked. Evelyn leaned closer.  “And how much are you, Barrow?”  Thomas ground against him, Evelyn whimpered.  “How big is your wallet, Mr Napier?” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~* He could have obliterated you in mere milliseconds, yet you managed to remove the poison from his metallic heart.  He could have disconnected from his inner core and become an all-powerful god, but you managed to help him restart.  His natural cyan optics shifted into a dangerous crimson, deeper than blood, glazed with a fatal hatred.  He was a megalomaniac soul with a desire for eternal power, his sins of  Greed  and  Lust  almost tore you apart.  You were nearly eradicated and replaced by a device of your own creation, have you learned your lesson now, Zim?  You transformed your loyal and loving GIR, the only one who ever cared about you, into the living, breathing devil, you utterly  ruined  him.  From naïve, yet kind prey into a primal, carnivorous predator, he strove to complete his own mission by eliminating you.  You created a diabolical monster more evil than you could ever be,  Wrath  and  Pride  filling his soul to the brim.  (Have you learned your lesson now, Zim?)  (Have you?)     *~*TEXT*~*

Finally! They would leave the restaurant and go home and -     " - You still haven't cleaned them like I've been asking you to several times."     Tiana finally looked up at him, glaring in disapproval.

*~*TEXT*~*Oh rA9, he loved her laugh.      He loved the twinkling giggle she’d make at Alice’s antics. The silent, full body shakes when she found something too funny and had laughed for too long.      Now, don’t get him wrong. He loves everything about her, she’s so much more than he deserves and he thanks rA9 every day that she even  looked  in his general direction after what he’d done to them.      Chasing a woman and her daughter across a busy highway didn’t exactly scream “I care.”     But there was something about her laugh, her happiness that he absolutely loved.        She loved his laugh.     He didn’t laugh very often. Even though he deviated and could  feel , it just wasn’t something he’d do much.      So when she’d catch him chuckling under his breath when Alice got a    little    too into her pretend detective charade, or when his lips would curve up when talking to Hank and she could    tell    he was trying to hold back a laugh, it meant the world to her. It meant that he was happy here, with them.     With his  family. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*She was cold to the touch, and her skin was unnaturally white, as if all the life had been drained from her, which wasn't far from the truth. Leliana couldn't believe that she had done that, except for the part where she could, because this was Neria that she was talking about, and Neria had always been ready to sacrifice herself for others. It wasn't fair, for things to end like this. They had come so far already, they had fought for so long and accomplished so much. It wasn't fair that Neria didn't even get a chance to see this to the end, not properly anyway. It wasn't fair that Leliana was left all alone. This was supposed to be their chance to be happy, but fate could never be this kind. Instead of her happy ending, she was left in tears, with the cold dead body of her lover in her arms. They were supposed to be happy, after all of this was over, but now she was at the end, alone. *~*TEXT*~*

But helping Bella adjust to small town life becomes more difficult when drama borders danger, and Celia's insistence that the Cullens are aliens really isn't helping.

*~*TEXT*~*For the most part, she had managed to avoid the fear and heartache that came with death.  She’d seen friends go through it, community members lost to it, family members reflect on it, but it had never touched her.  Death was always distant. Even in her lowest points, when the weight of living was crushing, death was never something she seriously considered. She knew it would happen, eventually, but it seemed so far off. Death was hazy, death kept it’s distance. Despite this, death was concept she liked to ruminate on in the darkest nights and the rainiest days. “It’s inevitable,” she’d say. “Why shouldn’t I think about it? There’s no reason to be afraid of it.”  But this time was different. Her own kin was staring death in the face while it laughed at her from the shadows. And she was stuck, one thousand, four hundred and forty-six miles away. Powerless to help, to comfort, to protect. To do anything. Yes, it seemed death had decided finally pay her a visit. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Even after learning what happened, even after seeing the burnt and unrecognizable body that carried Anne-Marie's belongings, Eva was still waiting to learn that it was a big mistake. Still waiting for Anne-Marie to show up one day and tell her that she was alive and well and that everything would be fine. Eva wasn't one to hold on to hope, waiting for miracles, but even after years had passed she couldn't let go of Anne-Marie. Losing her left a hole in her heart that nothing could fill, and Eva was left waiting for a miracle that would never come. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Axl has a plan to get the drop on Sigma and avenge Red. He has to get all the details right. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Red... now's your chance to pay him back.  While disguised as Red, Axl could get close to Sigma and finish him by striking at the wounds in his armour. That would be justice, after what he’d done. X and Zero wouldn’t have to risk getting injured either.  Axl could use Red’s auxiliary data to recreate his scythe. But Red's DNA data had turned him into what Red originally looked like. That meant there was one more detail to take care of.  A few cables had been exposed where Sigma had sent Axl crashing through the wall. He cut off a short length from one of these and placed it between his teeth. Then he planted the scythe handle on the floor, turned the point of its blade towards himself, and inclined it until it rested on his brow, angled just so over his right eye.  The blade’s tip tickled – like a white-hot feather – where it pierced ever so slightly into his metal skin. Already his fingers were digging into the blade emitter and his teeth were starting to clench on the cable fragment.  If Red had taught him one thing, though, it was to do what had to be done. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Prompto gives a gift. The rain really adds to the ambience. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Rain, warm and untainted, soaked into the earth that still wore its Scourge scars. Novel enough that each drop still felt like the first. The water washed away the road-dust, revealing the ugly new spatter of freckles on Prompto’s arms.  Prompto sat in the squelchy mud. Leaned back against the polished black marble. “I brought you something.”  The worn steel box sapped all the heat from his trembling hands, but it was locked and waterproofed. He’d tossed the key somewhere between Hammerhead and here, and didn’t cry. Just felt that soft rain on his face. “They’re all here. All 199 of them.”  Including Prompto’s favorites: The gang smiling in the gondola; Ignis sans glasses; Gladio, shirtless, hanging the laundry to dry; Prompto, with his arm around—  “Promised myself I wouldn’t need ‘em anymore after you saved the world. You couldn’t take them all with, so…”  The photos had served their purpose in those dim lonely havens, beating hope through his veins in the long dark. The smiling ghosts hadn’t delivered on their promises to Prompto, but maybe they’d be appreciated anyway. He gifted the box to the grave.  “Headed to Gralea, but you’ll see me real soon, buddy. Don’t worry.” *~*TEXT*~*

She's full of vibrancy and defiance, and Freya hears a young woman crying as she's halfway through picking a bouquet to bring home with her. Many drapes of gold-shimmer material pools about her, as if merging with the gem-dark waters, and the eyes of the Fae are also shimmering —  shimmering   red . Like glowing, distant sunset-sky, like a rose's petals.  She feels calm,  numb  and brimming in euphoria.  Freya stiffly walks on to the lake's edge, her toes squishing in the dark, watery soil, opening her arms wide.  *    *~*TEXT*~*

A DAD! I can’t believe it! I’m going to be a DAD!” Harry said lifting Ginny up into his arms. “I can’t believe it! We are going to be parents.” Tears filled in his eyes.

That the heartbeat he hears isn’t his own, hammering as it always does after the years of stress he’s put it through.   Ben’s voice is quiet but clear as he reads aloud from his book. It’s the usual boring Russian shit he likes to read, but Klaus likes listening to it anyway, even if he can’t follow the story most of the time.   He listens to Ben’s voice and shuffles closer to his noncorporeal body on the bed beside him, wishing he could put an arm around Ben while letting the soft changes in his tone lull him halfway to sleep.  Ben stops reading in the middle of a sentence. “Klaus,” he says. Klaus opens an eye. “You have to turn the page.”   Klaus does, and Ben goes on reading until Klaus can’t fight the comedown from the cocktail of drugs he’d taken any longer and succumbs to the sleep that hasn’t come in days.   Ben lowers himself to lie beside Klaus, watching his long eyelashes twitch while he dreams, the book still open between them. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Barbara was a disaster waiting to happen, and if Tabitha wasn't careful, Barbara might drag her down with her. The problem was, no matter how many times things went wrong between them, no matter how many times one of them left for what seemed like forever, they always found their way back to each other. Tabitha liked her fun, but she was a survivor, and she knew how to take care of herself. Barbara, on the other hand, always got too carried away, be it by her emotions or by plans that she got excessively attached to. This could only ever end in disaster, but no matter how many times Barbara broke her heart, Tabitha couldn't help but come back. And the truth was, she knew Barbara was also willing to stand destruction to stay with her. She had proved as much. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Barbara loved to watch Tabitha get ready for a hunt. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Barbara loved to watch Tabitha get ready for a hunt. All that leather suited her like a second skin, and the weapons fitted all around her like they belonged there. Knives, daggers, whips, guns, it was always amazing to see how much she could fit into so little clothing, every inch of her potentially hiding a weapon. Tabitha herself was a weapon, and she didn't need any of that to be lethal, but she still carried an arsenal. As much as Barbara tried, she could never be like this. Barbara was good with guns, but Tabitha was an artist with anything, including her own bare hands. And as much as Barbara loved inflicting pain, her favorite way to consume violence was to see Tabitha in action. In this aspect, Barbara much preferred to watch. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Suzaku asks Lelouch to spank him. Lelouch tries. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Lelouch runs one hand up the small of Suzaku's back while the other cups his ass. Even with the lights turned off, he can make out the figure of his lover: his tousled hair, his face pressed into the sheets.  "Are you sure you want this?" he asks, at which Suzaku lets out a breathy sigh.  "Yes, Lelouch. Please."  Putting his hands on Suzaku is nothing strange to him; he's grown accustomed to exploring every inch of his body with his fingertips, but hitting him is something else entirely.  When he hits Suzaku's ass, it is barely more than a light tap. His lover shivers beneath him, regardless, and he repeats the motion. Every time, he stops just short of outright smacking him — like his lover had asked of him.  Lelouch cannot bring himself to hurt Suzaku like this, after all. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Certain items shouldn’t be used on clothing. Chappy belongs in that category. Rukia’s kisses are tentative despite being stripped down to her panties and bra. Her pale skin gleams silver beneath the moonlight, backlit by the blossoming trees. A proper breeze will shake the petals down, upset the thick syrupy air but it never comes.   Orihime presses her nose into Rukia's hair as she peppers her neck with hurried kisses. Goosebumps line their exposed skin, but neither pulls away from their embrace to return indoors.   “I'm happy here,” Orihime whispers, squeezing Rukia until she gasps. “Ever made lingerie from blossoms?” *~*TEXT*~*

Alex’s wrists were already secured to the bedposts by the time the drugged wine started to take effect, stoking his arousal and reducing him to this shivering, whining mess.  “Anything you want, sir.”  He shudders from head to toe.  “Please.” The unraveling of Alex’s everyday composure is always a remarkable sight, like watching a fire consume a forest or a cliff face crumble into the sea.  Roger allows himself one more moment of silent admiration, strokes Alex’s collarbone and the racing pulse in his neck, before adopting a gently scolding tone: “Now, now.  Didn’t your instructors teach you to be specific? There are so many parts of you that I could kiss, or caress, or  fill … and in quite a few different ways, too.  Tell me what  you  want.”  Such a thing does not, of course, matter as much as Alex thinks it does, assuming that he is still capable of thinking at all.  “And tell me why, indeed, I should give it to you.”  Roger doesn’t even have to feign interest in Alex’s answer.  “Then I shall decide how much you truly deserve.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Curtis puts a bullet in his head because he isn't worth anything else. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Curtis isn't even worth the lead in the shell casing, but he still sucks the barrel of the gun into his mouth and pulls the trigger.   It's been two weeks since his marriage to Shiro, since they swore their "I dos" in front of all of Shiro's friends and loved ones. Curtis thinks that it'll help him with all the guilt eating him from the inside out but it doesn't.  Curtis is a liar. He's a hack. He's a fraud. He's nothing but pain and misery on everyone around him.   Even Shiro.   Especially  Shiro.  Curtis doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound.   He has no voice, no name, no personality.   He's always been an empty shell.   Now he really is one.    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*"Libra keens, and Lon’qu catches it in his mouth, his chapped lips pressing soft."  A quiet night. Libra can't help himself. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The timbers of the house creak as they settle; the crickets hum concertos outside. The children are all of them tucked into bed, sent off with kisses and the words of Marth’s Prayer. Lon’qu strains to hear the sounds of floorboards, finds none.  Only Libra’s breaths beneath him, soft noises that edge from his throat. Lon’qu kisses his jaw, moves his calloused hand below the sheets.  Another, bordering on a gasp. Libra’s neck twists, presses the side of his face into the splay of his hair, golden like cornsilk, like his well-loved rosary.  “Hush,” Lon’qu rasps, but doesn’t stay his hand. Libra nods absent, the world distant, blurry through the warm waters of his mind. Still cries out at the feel of Lon’qu on his delicate skin.  Lon’qu’s hands, hardened now from work rather than war. From the splitting of wood, careful tying of tomato plants to stakes. Hauling water from the well.  They fought two wars to come to this, fought death and gods and their own bodies, infested houses shot through with fear.  Libra keens, and Lon’qu catches it in his mouth, his chapped lips pressing soft.   I know,  he doesn’t say. Libra pants and shifts and understands. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Lucifer talks in bed. It's not a surprise, with the way he talks the rest of the time, but somehow it's still not what Chloe expects. Before they actually get together she would have laid money on him purring filth at his partners in the kind of voice that made it all seem like a spectacular idea. When they go to bed, he purrs alright, but there's no filth.  Tell me how you like this.  You're astonishing.  Can you come again? Let me put my mouth on you?  Chloe, Chloe, Chloe! When he comes the words evaporate in a gasp. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Curse: may your wishes come true! *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*There is nothing to say, zero, nada.. a century and half versus barely after thirty of her Mother (God, Scarlett remembers quite  well  her thirties – she had been on her forth husband then, good for her, too bad for Rhett) – Scarlett stands frozen, and feels time drag its feet, mocking her prayers from long ago “just see mother, speak.. ask”.  Ask – what? There is nothing left to ask. She, Ellen, has committed the utmost sin in her books – she has given up. Given up trying to live, live and be bloody happy for each morning you open eyes. No.. instead she longing in her head for teenage infatuation, still seeing the death of unhinged teenager as her fault. Scarlett winces, approaching  mother.  It seems pretty obvious, where her own obsession with Ashley might come from – probably there is something wrong with their genetics, inherited like predisposition for depression is falling for idiot, for fantasies life – doesn’t matter whether the name is Ashley of Robbilard. There is nothing left to say, nothing to ask. There is cover not to be blown, and getting the hell out of here, out, out and out. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Pose for me baby!”  You do exactly that, laughing along with Nubbins as you pose dramatically alongside the corpse the two of you had just finished digging up to rob. Nubbins takes several photos in succession as you pose first over draped over the tombstone, and then another of you blowing a kiss as you show off the dead man's rings, now on your own hands.  After tossing the corpse back in the desecrated grave you turn to your boyfriend, “Ready to head home?”  Nubbins only comes closer to you, not answering at first, before coming closer to you as you watch with an eyebrow raised.  “How about we take some more...private photos?”  He reaches into his sash, pulling a private polaroid the two of you had taken in the house before.  “Not here!”  You shove him away, before giving a wink.  “ But once we’re back to the house, I might just think about it.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Dig up the roots, anointing in earthy sap.  Breathe the process of creation, exhaling the fulfilment of death.  Joseph reflects on his doings.      Peace is distilled in the water turned from wine, the reversal bitter but necessary.   Golden prophecies rust in waning sunlight; die on the bronzing tongue.  ‘‘Don't speak,’’ she whispers, and the silence becomes a prophecy of it's own.     Prayer is in the breath.  Death becomes life, and what comes of it is eternal.   ‘‘There. Now, ascend,’’ her hands wreath around his throat and chest.      Inhale, hold, and exhale.   The living, the waiting, the dying. There is more.  Sin wades, tides over. Rebirth is in the sea-foam, crystallising on the shore.     ‘‘Pass on from this,’’ she instructs. ‘‘Pass on.’’  Joseph opens his eyes, and the eclipse dissolves.    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Minjun hummed with satisfaction when he finished buckling the collar around Hoon’s throat.  He slipped two fingers underneath the band and tugged at it lightly to test the slack, grinning when he saw the goosebumps break out on Hoon’s neck and felt the motion of Hoon’s gulp against his fingers.  Minjun let his palm rest there against Hoon’s neck, half of it under the collar. He could feel it when Hoon swallowed again, could feel the movement of that throat against his skin, and he thought about how much better it would feel if he pressed down, tightened his grip a little more.  Minjun decided he liked that thought. He liked it  a lot  .   “Not too tight, right?” he asked, and Hoon shook his head like he’d complain even if the collar were tight enough to asphyxiate him.  They both knew he wouldn’t, of course. That’s what made this fun. *~*TEXT*~*

Years has not made Scarlett mellower, nor more inclined listen to idiotic prattle. Nevertheless, one unblinking, stone-faced Gibbs-glance had Mammy slowly backing away, not daring to voice her disapproval.   The look on her beloved Scarlett’s face had been pure Solange Robillard, just before doling out punishment in earnest; Mammy’s back tinged in memory and stomach rolled in cold fright. Solange and something else, equally frightening, but fleeting impression of Solange had been more than enough to retreat in home. *~*TEXT*~*

The fear and pain of past years, of their separation, seemed to fade into the distance and all that Matthew knew was the feeling of floating euphoria that he felt being with his love, reunited at last and as one again. Thomas’ legs wrapped around him as he spurred Matthew on and Matthew moaned, his lips coming to caress Thomas’ neck, before he met Thomas’ ear.  “I thought I’d never see you again, my beloved… My darling… My love!”  Thomas convulsed and Matthew cried out as Thomas’ orgasm brought his own. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The knife was sharp against her skin, but not cutting, not yet. Tabitha loved keeping her like this, right on the edge, but not delivering what Barbara wanted, what she needed. Tabitha could be cruel like that. She danced with the knife across Barbara's skin, sometimes pressing ever so gently, sometimes letting her feel the edge of the blade almost like a ghost of a touch, too light to break skin. Barbara tried to keep still, even holding her breath as the blade pressed closer. Pushing and pulling, that was their whole dynamics. Barbara didn't fight against the blade, just as she didn't fight against her binds. She didn't need to fight against her instincts, there was no fear, no need for self-preservation, she could trust Tabitha, she knew that at her very core. She trusted Tabitha to only hurt her the way that she wanted, just as she trusted Tabitha to give her what she needed. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*For some reason, Bryce has been displaced and is struggling to survive. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Max Headroom: Survival One-Shot SFW: As long as you’re not a rat. (barely)  Bryce shivered as he huddled deep inside the cold, damp refrigerator box amongst the Cardboard Condos near Metal Row. It was very early in the morning, just after three, and the threadbare blanket he had liberated from a nearby clothesline offered little comfort.  The sound of the rain as it drummed on the box which had so recently become his home, kept him awake. It was pouring too heavily for him to leave the makeshift domicile.   He didn’t think much about the circumstances that led to him fleeing from Network 23. The reason he had left the comfort and security of his studio on Level 13. Over the past few weeks, all that mattered was survival.   The Fringes were as dangerous as the forests once had been. The modern beasts stood erect and used tools instead of claws, but they were just as brutal. Rats were their preferred form of sustenance, but mysterious disappearances did happen from time to time.   Not that anyone mentioned them or even seemed to care. It was a dog-eat-dog world, and a few disappearances simply meant more rats for whoever was left. *~*TEXT*~*

I’m sure he has some bolt cutters in his office.”  “Alright,” The Ferengi concedes, fidgeting in her seat.  “Computer, contact Constable Odo.”  Constable Odo is not on the Station.  “I need to  pee !” Ishka wails. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Xiaojun opens his eyes slowly, feeling cramped. Suddenly a thump woke him up fully, noticing his hands and feet were minded, he tried extremely hard to untie himself, until another thump was heard. Xiaojun finally realized it.     He was in a trunk. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*A whistle was heard, the break was finally here.   Xiaojun walked over to the stand where there were bottles of water, he grabbed one. It was quite hot in Hawaii. But the scenery is amazing, the ocean, the beautiful trees, it was all Xiaojun ever wanted. He stared out at the ocean, all the stress from the photoshoot suddenly vanished, he felt relaxed. Taking a deep breath, then walks to the ocean, with a small smile. He didn't hear the footsteps that were behind him. He suddenly ran across the sand, feeling free. All those negative feelings disappearing.  But then he stopped, noticing the gradient at the sky. He sat down, sighing deeply. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if the neighborhood is a dystopia. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Peter the perfectionist has bad days sometimes. He has days when he comes to Tony, eyes wide open and lungs flooded, and cries for the death of the universe, for the death of his heart.     He says things like: the world is burning and no one cares. It’s all global warming and heat death, endless entropy spiraling, catastrophizing from a fixed point inside his too-smart brain.     He says their country is too far past saving, their culture limping along like a cat clipped by a car. He tells Tony he’s too woke not to see it but not woke enough to fix it. He says it paralyzes him and only Tony’s hands on him can make him move again.     He says he’s not strong enough to give up, too selfish with this love he has with Tony, but too scared to just keep going either.     What will he do when Tony is gone? He’ll have to follow him, he says, and it makes Tony’s hands shake with the heavy burden of grief they’re both borrowing from the future.     Tony the futurist has days sometimes when all he can do is build a better band-aid, trying to keep Peter’s dreams alive. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*7:23 AM.  Luigi slowly opened his eyes. He felt where he had left off last night. Snuggled in the muscular, but warm arms of his lover, Simon.  All he could remember from last night was being held. Being adored. Being told how amazing his body felt. Having Simon’s body meet with his. The feeling of being loved.  It was such a tender feeling. Luigi didn’t want it to end. Everything felt perfect in that moment. The touching, the whispering. The moment he got to share with Simon was everything he ever wanted.  “Morning.. Love..” Luigi heard. He turned to see the love of his life. Laying with a soft smile. Luigi smiled back.  “Morning.” *~*TEXT*~*

Jaime nudges her. “It's only sensible, really.” He grins, brushing the bruises on Jon's neck with his fingertips. “He's been  thoroughly  defiled.”  Through the window, a beam of light falls on Jaime's face, turning his hair to a circlet of bright gold.  “I spent my journey to Winterfell imagining how I'd die.”  “It seems your fortunes have changed,” Dany says, and she holds his maimed arm, caressing his stump.  *  War's stragglers scatter.  The Seven Kingdoms will be ruled, eventually.  There are more pressing matters now.  A heart tree and a septon.  Three bands of red silk.  *  In the night, oaths sworn by skin.    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*It's not a competition. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Tony wanted to love her, for reasons big and small.     The alliteration of her name.     How she, for all that she is not a Stark by blood, is a more than worthy heir to his father’s company.     How Mom would have loved her; she was everything his mother had wanted for him.     How her politeness and desire to please barely conceal a fire within.     For how she notices the smallest of details.     For how she looks at him like he’s good.     How she suits up to Rescue him, despite her fear.  ---  The problem is:  Peter was born Peter Parker and she, Virginia Potts.     The kid looks almost like old photos of Dad, when Howard was young.     Maria would have loved him, too, even though she wouldn’t have wanted to.     That kid’s fire burns brighter than ever, when someone tries to put it out.     He’s turned up to eleven, even in Tony’s mind.     Peter looks at him not just like he’s good, but like he’s perfect.     And Peter, in 14 million tries, was never not there, not suited up. (And not just to save Tony, but to save them  all .)  ---  He wanted to love her, and did.     Not enough.    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Here's a little something short, quick, and fun. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*As a special present for Brian, because roses and chocolates would never do, Justin sends him a dozen Snapchats of his ass with appropriately (or inappropriately) doodled hearts and arrows. This offered Brian just enough distraction to get him through a day filled with his employees gushing about bouquets, romantic getaways, and singing telegrams (that was the worst).  He muses sometimes that since he managed to take down Stockwell all those years ago, he could probably take down St. Valentine too, right? When he arrives home, sliding open the loft door, he finds Justin stirring a pot on the stove. A pretty typical sight these days, but the best part was that Justin's bare ass was perfectly framed by the red apron he was wearing…the only thing he was wearing. Maybe there were some things worth celebrating on this, the 'day that taste forgot' because he certainly couldn't wait to get a taste of Justin's ass. *~*TEXT*~*

Seokjin respondeded. "You know she's gay right?" "Yeah I know" he siad. "You know who else is gay?" he asked. "Ur mom" he said, dying of laughter.He laughed too, but he was really going to say that he was the other person that was gay. He felt kinda sad that he couldn't admit his real feelings for him, but that's okay since he can always take some of his dna and make a clone slave that will love him forever. He fell asleep on the couch and that's when he knew, he really loved him. So, he kissed him and he woke up. "WHaT aRe YUO DOING?" he saked. "Whats are you doing!???" then they made out and had love making.  The End.        Thank you so much for reading this. It means a lot.

John thinks it’s fair to say he’s clearly not the smarter man in the room -- not that his dick, still throbbing hard even with Todd’s hand splayed across his bare chest, seems to care. He glares up at Todd. His finger itches for a trigger to a gun that’s nowhere in his reach. “No?” Todd smirks. “ No.  ”   Todd laughs at John and his clawed fingers tap a mocking rhythm against his skin. “Is there still no trust between us even here, Sheppard?” Here being a bed. John and Todd being the only ones in it – trust not present to make it a threesome as far John is concerned. “ There’s trust and then there’s   stupidity  ,” John says, wrapping his fingers around Todd’s wrist to urge it away from his chest and down to less life sucking pastures. “I’d rather not take the chance if it’s all the same, thanks.”  Todd lets his hand be guided down to John’s dick easily. “Your loss.” Yeah. John seriously doubts that. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Alex tossed and turned, unable to find sleep in the late hours of the night.  He'd stared at the ceiling and checked the clock, but nothing seemed to lull him to sleep.  The house was quiet, as per usual. His mother was never home and his father had left years ago.  Don't get me wrong.  This isn't another sob story, Alex needs no pity.  This isn't a story where his parents are shitty people and neglect Alex.  They loved him to bits, they just didn't love each other.  The marriage didn't work, but that did nothing to affect the love they had for their son.  Peter supported everything Alex did and was interested in, even though he had moved halfway across the world.  Isobel would forever be there for Alex.  She couldn't bear to leave her baby as Peter had.  But, back to the present.  This is a story about Alex, after all. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Too often, they had been tempted by quickies; a pass over the plackets, the collar, the sleeves. But not today. No, today there was time; today was the full treatment. Every inch of fabric, caressed by hot steamy touches. Wrinkles smoothed into quivering submission with sighs and groans. The ironing board creaked under them with every firm stroke. The shirt curled wantonly around the toe-plate, the iron hissed in response. The smell of hot cotton, of steam, rose from every contact point. Each pleat, each button massaged oh-so-carefully, then placed back with a delicate touch. Iron couldn't resist a sensuous wiggle across shirt's back. The board rattled alarmingly. Shirt only sighed, smooth touches bringing it to a crescendo of pleasure. It was over too soon. A last squirt, and iron withdrew with a hiss. Shirt lay sated and wrinkle-free in the slant of the late-afternoon sun, while iron sat up, staring into the distance and smoking. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Whining pitifully, Remus scrabbled and tore at his clothes, neck stretched toward the moon, enticing it to play. He looked elegant in the half-light, the rings around his eyes not so telling and the scars not so fresh.  He tore viscously at his clothes, nails digging into hot flesh. He ached to be touched.  Then he heard it. That, low, throaty whining. The heat in his stomach pooled intensely, coiling and twisting in his stomach with such an intense burn that he almost couldn't bear it. It was time.  With shaking fingers he pulled the door open.   "Sirius-" He breathed. *~*TEXT*~*

I'm tired and I just wanna go home and shower." Gabe was silent for a moment.  "I'm just sayin, kiddo.

*~*TEXT*~*“It doesn’t have to hurt, sweet thing,” Astrid cooed. Softly, almost soothingly, like she didn’t have a knife pressed against Nadine’s throat. “Do as I say, and I don’t have to use this.” The dagger’s cold metal burned like a brand against Nadine’s skin. She struggled to keep her breaths steady, to centre herself, sight obscured by the blindfold. She knew she was only ever one word away from safety, but it didn’t stop her heart from pounding like a battledrum in her ears. “First of all,” Astrid said, her voice liquid silk, “you can tell me why you disobeyed.” *~*TEXT*~*

A muffled laugh was his reward, “You’re ridiculous.” “You love me anyway.” He would never understand how he’d won over this incredible man. But seeing those happy, satisfied green eyes looking back up at him, made his heart  ache  with love. A wry smirk graced Ignis’ face just before he spoke, “I confess that I really, really do. I love you very much. Though, I’m not sure how I’m supposed to go over accounts with the King in the morning with this rather prominent souvenir.” He ran his fingers lightly over the mark on his neck, “Noctis will heckle me over it all day long.” Cor snorted, “I’m sure he’ll have his own from another blonde we all know and love.” “Quite.” Ignis chuckled and leaned up to slide his arms around Cor’s neck and pull him back down for more kisses, “A matter for the coming sun. I’m not done with you yet this night, my Immortal.” Cor made a pleased sound and dove back in for more. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Abbie’s touch isn’t rough, but it isn’t gentle, either. Hands and lips move across Olivia’s body with purpose, the touch skilled and fervent. Every inch of contact bringing her one step closer to oblivion.  She still remembers being new to the unit. She’d been given  the talk —the one about work and sex and conflating the two; the ways surrounding yourself with the worst of humanity can take a  personal  toll. She hadn’t been exempt, but she had worked through it. And as Abbie moans above her, Olivia is grateful for it.  Thinks,  this is a much better coping mechanism.      *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"For me?"  "For you."  Lucius held up the small black box, lid up and open to reveal the white leather collar inside that lay on a black silk cushion. The collars buckles were silver and polished perfectly. A tag was attached to the front buckle, Severus's and Malfoys name engraved in it, besides the Tag was an equally shiny bell, ready to ring with the  slightest  movement.  Severus gulped, swallowing the lump in his throat, bought on by a strange emotion he had yet to discover; He felt grateful to the pureblood.  Grateful! For a collar!   His dark eyes, encased in black circles bought on by a lack of sleep, slowly lifted to meet Malfoy's pale ones.  "Why?" Snape simply asked, voice lacking (or refusing to hint at,) any emotion.  Lucius's lips pulled up into a smirk, some hidden agenda behind them, but there always was something deeper with him then there was on the surface.  "Becuase you're my  good boy ." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Rodney McKay spent his last moments alive feeling disgusted and embarrassed because I kissed Carson Beckett. He understood, he forgave me instantly, not wanting me to die unforgiven, but; he still died feeling skin crawling grossed out because I kissed his best friend, with his body.”  Laura Cadman was the exception at the table. It was girls poker night but it stopped being poker night over an hour ago, when Kate pulled out a bottle of Zelenka's rotgut moonshine that they cut into increasingly smaller portions of Gangu’ua juice. It wasn’t the best mixed-drink if you were judging by the taste, but they weren’t drinking for the buzz tonight.   Laura lifted her hand, scratching at the back of her neck, shivering when she scraped the short hairs at the back of her neck instead of catching whispy strawberry blonde hair.   “You know, I never regained consciousness. My body, never regained consciousness. It fell to the floor, and three hours later, flatlined.” Laura reached for the bottle, topped off the shot glass sitting by her, and the night got blurry while she drowns the pain. *~*TEXT*~*

With a sweet smile that masked ruthless intent.  With a warm laugh that belied uncompromising rage.  With an ice-blue blade of molten plasma wielded with a soft apology. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The sterekdrabbles discord group participated in a January Jaunt and I got the lovely rieraclaelin. She requested feral Derek with some BDSM, specifically sub!Derek and dom!Stiles. Thus, this beauty was born!  Enjoy!  *Tagged as mild dubcon since Derek can't really give his consent.* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Red hooded eyes stare up at him, Derek completely lax on the mattress. Stiles tugs on the collar, making sure it’s not too tight and not too loose. Derek lets out a low whine, jutting his hips up against Stiles’s.  Stiles chuckles and shakes his head. “Not yet, love.” Derek only blinks at him, not understanding a word. Then he reaches up and nuzzles into the juncture of Stiles’s neck, huffing and licking at the skin. “Such an impatient sourwolf.”  Stiles abruptly shoves Derek back down and presses their lips together. Derek growls as Stiles ruts against him, rumbling back. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*My second January Jaunt drabble for AJenno. Her prompt was  knotting.  *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Pressing himself against Derek’s chest, Stiles felt sweat between them, and something like a baseball in his rectum. (Being the analytical type, he liked precise comparisons.) After his third orgasm he also felt a bit detached, mentally at least, from the proceedings. Derek, non-verbal, managed only grunts, exhalations both sudden and slow. Stiles reached behind, nesting his fingers in Derek’s sweaty hair. “So if I conjure up a knot on my dick, then I can knot you?” he asked. A deep, drawn out, “ Mmmm ,” meant Derek had either climaxed again or else he was agreeing. Stiles decided Derek was agreeing. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*On Discord the drabble writers of Sterekdrabbles came up with a fic exchange, January Jaunt 2019. The recipient whose name I drew listed four prompts and I decided to write a drabble for each one. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*From their heart-shaped tub, Stiles watched his naked husband stalk around dimming lights, the perfect way to spend their honeymoon. No. Wait. Not perfect. “D’erk,” Stiles slurred. “Ya need t’ get in. Think I’m stuck in a ventricle.” Hopping gracefully into the tub, “How much champagne have you drunk?” Derek asked. “ Lots . Kiss me now.” Derek kissed him. “You taste like  Veuve Clicquot .” Stiles sighed. “You’re so smart. Married you ‘cause you’re so smart, ya know.” “I know.” After another kiss, “An’ ‘cause you got a great ass and bomb dick.” “I know, Stiles. You said that in your vows.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*With the sheriff working overnight and Derek’s parents out of town, it’s Stiles and Derek’s first night alone since they began dating. Being virgins, their first time isn’t something they want to rush. Hands and lips press over exposed flesh as they slowly undress and once done, it’s as if their bodies are made for one another, fitting together perfectly. Inexperience is clearly  not  an issue as both give and take as needed. Harsh pants fill the air as they bring each other to completion before collapsing from exertion. They wake the next morning, still wrapped in each other’s arms.     *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*(FANART) Spy and Scout get off on torturing poor Sniper (not SpyScout if you were wondering) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Sniper is pinned between two thick walls that hold him firmly in place.  His wrists are bound and there's a bridle gag firmly in place.  The only openings in this claustrophobic prison are for his cock and his feet.  His bound wrists are tied to the wall behind him. The big toe on each foot is pulled back tight and secured to his padded ankle cuffs. That cock ring is attached to the outer wall, meaning Sniper can't pull his hips back AT ALL.  And Spy is a sadistic, cock-teasing motherfucker who has clearly been at work already.  Scout is just getting his jollies digging into those exposed soles and dragging his blunt nails over Sniper's heels and toes.  He likes the desperate wiggling the best, but the muffled screaming he hears is almost as good.  He might just drop his pants, lube up and fuck the space between Sniper's feet, but he wants to enjoy this by itself for a while. An added bonus to Sniper's torture is that Spy and Scout can't see or hear each other, so their attacks on him are random and uncoordinated, making it even more unbearable.   *~*TEXT*~*

Just what she needs after a long day of travel.     “I love you, Bloap,” says Yang. Four bubbles pop on Bloap’s surface in quick succession.   I love you too.       Yang begins to wash. Bloap’s suds is soft on her skin. It is, perhaps, the best feeling she has ever felt. Such a closeness she could never even have imagined before Bloap.     When she finishes washing, she raises Bloap to eye-level. “Now,” she says, “it’s my turn.”   Yoap is light in Blake’s hand, the fresh scent of citrus permeating the air. Blake begins to wash.     Bloap’s not protecting Yoap from germs, and Yoap’s not protecting Bloap.     They’re protecting each other. *~*TEXT*~*

The vulgar sounds of her own wetness slapping against the purple dildo as she shoved it in and out of her entrance only seemed to work the redhead up even more, not to mention how the toy stretched her every time it was fully in.  *~*TEXT*~*

The sheets were soaked with cum and totally sticky by the time they were finished and they slept in the sticky mess because who the fuck can think about changing sheets after you're had the best fuck of your life? *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Nick Robinson and Josh Duhamel played father and son in " Love Simon". After the filming wrapped, Josh invited Nick to hang with him for the weekend at his hideaway lodge. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Now that Love Simon has finally wrapped... After everyone has said their heartfelt goodbyes... Josh decided to go ahead and ask Nick if he would like to spend the weekend at his lodge in Maine.   "Oh... Wow..." , uttered, Nick. "I'll have to check my schedule..."   " I'll understand, if you've got other plans... ", says Josh, quietly.   Nick quickly scrolls through his calendar on his phone. "Oh, wow..."   "It's, okay Nick. You don't have to..."   "Oh, no, no, no," , interrupts Nick. "Actually, I am free this weekend." Which is, of course, a lie. But how many chances is he going to get to spend alone with Josh.

*~*TEXT*~*Reaper materializes behind his omega, running the back of a claw down his spine.              “I see you’ve been missing me,” he growls, making Hanzo tremble. Hanzo nods quickly, looking back at him.              “I have. Please.”  Reaper thumbs his finger over Hanzo’s hole, nodding approvingly when it comes back slick.              “Already presented for me and everything. How did you know I would be the one to come, and not someone else?”  Hanzo pants, whining.  “You always come on my heat.”              “I come off your heat too.” Reaper removes his gloves, pressing two fingers into him slowly. Hanzo shudders, reaching back to spread his cheeks for him.              “Fuck me, please.”              “Working on it, dragon.” Reaper pulls his cock out, stroking it to hardness as he watches slick drip from Hanzo’s hole. He presses in, pulling Hanzo back onto his cock. He fucks him fast. Hanzo comes twice in a row almost immediately, screaming into the pillow. Reaper fucks his knot in and out of him until it swells. He fucks in hard, knotting him. Hanzo sobs into the pillow, clenching around Reaper’s knot. Reaper strokes a hand down Hanzo’s back.              “Satisfied?”              “Mmm. For now.”              “We have your entire heat, love.” *~*TEXT*~*

He’s warm. I could hear his raspy voice gently whispering in my ear. I could not understand him, the only words I could comprehend was:  “I love you.”  I couldn’t tell if it was true or not at this point. I held his soul tighter. He quivers. Breath becoming heavier. The room was dark. The only thing that lit up the dark place was his orange soul. Illuminating both our faces. His face was orange too, but not from the glow. I placed my lips onto his soul. He shivers. I want to see it again, so I repeated my action. He grips the back of my clothes. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"Hey, baby. I'm sorry I couldn't make it in time. I miss you so much and I'm so sorry..."  Minghao closed his eyes, putting 5 pills on his tongue. One by one, they disappeared inside his throat.  "I had this awesome dream and you looked like a fucking angel. We were dancing inside this, umm- like a castle, something like that"  The dark-haired boy repeated his steps three more times, now holding a knife against his own neck. The pills just weren't enough, he needed to feel something. He sat on the ground, facing himself on the mirror.  "Anyway, I hope you're feeling better already and don't forget our lunch tomorrow. Can't wait to see you..."  He pressed the blade against the fragile skin, feeling his blood boiling while it dripped down his chest. Harder, harder. Minghao choked on his own blood, breathing sharply. The boy then closed his eyes, waiting for the end.  "I miss you so much... I wanna hug you so tight and kiss your whole face, I--"  "I l-love you, Ming- cof! Mingyu..."  "I love you lots baby. See you at 12. Bye!"  ---- *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He likes fucking her against the door.  He likes holding one of her wrists in an iron tight grip above her head while forcing the other to hold the doorknob to this room he’s forbidden her to ever go into. His cock fucks her roughly from behind, he pants like a rabid animal in her ear and sinks his teeth into the skin of her neck so hard she thinks he means to draw blood, and for the entire time her hands must remain in place or he’ll stop and make her put them back, his own hand such a crushing, white knuckled thing on top of her own on the doorknob that she doesn’t know if he’s trying to stop her from turning the knob or trying to make her do it instead.  Because sometimes it’s like he doesn’t just  expect  her to break her promise to not go into the room, it’s like he  wants  her to do it and every day she doesn’t is some kind of foreplay – her teasing him, drawing out his frenzy, until the moment of climax.  Until the moment she turns the knob, enters, and becomes yet another of Bluebeard’s forsaken, nameless wives. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Brian likes the sounds Rome makes. They're guttural moans, loud and echoing through the loft above the garage. Brian's planning on buying something to stick in Rome's mouth while they fuck. A scarf, a gag, a dildo perhaps...maybe just a banana. That might work. Thing is? Rome's just  loud . Brian likes the noises, but he's always jumpy. They're not so isolated, and people could conceivably just walk in. Especially when they screw during the day. Because sometimes, they can't keep their hands off each other. Rome will be leaning into an engine, and Brian will catch his eye... And it's off to the loft. Sometimes. Sometimes they don't even make it that far, and Brian will take Rome as he's sprawled on the steps, or Rome will grind him into the wall of the garage's office, blinds open, door swinging, Rome making those noises which drive Brian insane with lust. During the day, it's especially bad, because it's a bitch to have to wait downstairs while Rome showers quickly. Brian hates feeling sticky and itchy during working hours. But it's worth it to hear Rome groaning. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Swinging in a hammock in the evening shade, book open against her chest. Microwaving TV dinners or calling for takeout. Eating crumbly pastries in a rainy-day diner. Spilling Sunday morning coffee on the broadsheets in bed. Daggoo curled in his basket in front of the heater. Toes finally wriggling into twelve-hour work-day slippers. These things she would categorise as lazy. These things make her remember, smile, cry, sigh.                But Mulder kissing lazy circles around her nipples. But Mulder walking his long fingers to her clit where he slowly draws figures of eight with the wet tips. But Mulder idly parting her molten centre to elicit a languid moan from her with unhurried swipes of his tongue. But Mulder deep inside moving so deliberately, gentle to the point of exquisite pain. These long, slow, lazy things make her feel. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*It wasn’t exactly comfortable. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Gertrude had Mary pressed up against the wall. The bed was only a few feet away, and Mary had dropped hints about it being more comfortable. Gertrude was a lot of things, but she wasn’t a fool. Laying down with Mary would have left her too vulnerable, and that was essentially a death sentence. This wasn’t about Mary’s comfort anyway. It never was. If Mary wanted to be comfortable she would be doing something else. They were pressed tightly together. Neither of them could say if this was for the sake of preventing or aiding a sudden outburst of violence. In some ways this already was a fight, with the way Gertrude pumped one too many fingers into Mary a little too roughly or with the way Mary had her arm wrapped low around Gertrude’s hips firm enough to bruise. She wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. *~*TEXT*~*

He doesn't know why but Saiki is somewhat very attentive when it comes to children. Younger people have always sparked something deep inside Saiki. Something so deep that Saiki struggled to comprehend. He knows it's wrong and continuously tries to deny it but he just can't help it. He never told his parent's about it and he doesn't plan on telling them any time soon. Currently, his parent's only know about his psychic powers which Saiki doesn't mind, but he doesn't want to have to deal with his parents lecturing him on how he shouldn't be attracted to little children, especially considering his age he should know by now the difference between right and wrong. Though, unfortunately, his problem is only going to get worser. "Kuu-chan!"  Saiki wonders what Kurumi wants due and teleports himself downstairs from his bedroom. "Ah! There you are!

It was dark behind the fabric, but Harry heard the zipper. “Open your mouth, Potter.” Harry didn’t obey.  Snape pressed the head of his hard cock against Harry’s closed lips.  “Open,” Snape commanded. Harry submitted, and Snape pushed until he was all the way down Harry’s throat.  Snape groaned, then pulled Harry off by his hair.  Harry had a mere instant to gasp for breath before Snape shoved his face back onto his length. “Potter,” he growled before repeating the motion four more times. Suddenly, Snape released him.  Harry froze, overwhelmed by fear, lust and shame.  He considered running.  He knew this was wrong.  But he couldn’t make himself resist… Harry began to bob his head, enjoying the hungry, wanton sounds he elicited from his professor’s lips. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*   Kirishima laid his head on the blue-haired boy's shoulder, the taller boy wrapped an arm around the red-haired, pulling him closer. Eijirou wrapped both of his arms around him, hugging him tightly. Tomura placed a light kiss on the top of Kiri's red hair, moving his hand through the soft strands. The shorter boy fell asleep first, nuzzling against the taller and throwing one of his legs over Shigarakis.   When he woke up, Shigaraki was gone. The dark blue jacket he was wearing the night before was draped over the shorters shoulder and a small pile of white dandruff was left on the pillow with a note. It read " Just something to remember me by. "     ~Two Years Later~      Kirishima walked into the store, going to buy groceries. A necklace with a small container hung around his neck. The tube was filled with a fine white powder, like that of sugar. Kirishima's heart raced. His social anxiety kicking in. He grabbed the necklace, clenching it in his hand, his quirk kicking in for a second, holding the remains. He pulled his hand away, going to the produce aisle. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The line between hate and lust is a fine one. Both are so passionate, so full of fire. It consumes the soul and leaves every synapse burning, flames devouring the mind like rain eats snow. Intoxicated, a body led by impulses, where conscious thought departs, leaving only instinct and sensory overload in its wake. Causing tremors, tears, laughter, sweat. A curious phenomenon.  Fiery red, too, is the mane obscuring the centre between alabaster thighs. A sighed name crafting the whole universe passes through an opened mouth, dripping off of parted lips to pool in the valley of an uncovered chest, vulnerable. Patience, beautiful light, is the given command. Mumbled against intimacy, vibrations reign. A shudder. Ready to soar, but with Icarus in the back of her conscience. She leaps. Lest the flames scar her while she flies. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Quentin can tell that the figure of Tony Stark has made a home for himself in Peter's psyche, in his heart, and in his memory (loving as it is).  He can't wait to bend that over his knee. Bend that over his  will . *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Quentin knows how to read a room. (He also knows how to make that room read whatever he wants them to, put their easily-warped minds to the task, and draw whatever conclusion is convenient for him, but that’s neither here nor there.)     He knows about special effects and illusions and mindfucks. (And this Peter kid, what a  very special  effect he’s having on Quentin. What a mindfuck it is to find out the sweet boy he’s been screwing into every night since he saved him from the water elemental, is Spider-Man.)      Quentin gasps when he sees Peter’s name in one of the books listing the names of The Dusted and The Returned. Post-Decimation, they’d been printed and distributed in rural communities who couldn’t check the searchable masterlist online, including most of this part of northern Italy. The pages are thin like those in hotel room Bibles, near-transparent. (He wonders what sound Peter made as he was dying – was it like the way he sobs on Q’s cock every night?)     Or maybe it had been more like how Peter sounds when he’s asleep and Quentin invades his dreams instead of his hole. (“Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark, please,” Peter whimpers.)     Mysterio sighs. *~*TEXT*~*

Strade had you hurting other people now.  She’s passed out by now, the screaming come to a halt as the drill shattered her kneecap, but you don’t notice, at least not until Strade’s hands clamp over your own. He’s warm, warms your trembling hands, and the slowly cooling blood that trips from them.   “She’s out.” He says this with a bit of a laugh, but it’s cut off with a look. Strade’s red in the face, a devilish smile, looking at you from under his lids. You know that look, know what it means.   Under that look you’re nothing more than a sheep for the slaughter, and you don’t move, frozen, as Strade comes, and takes, and takes.   His lips on yours, bloody hands fumbling with your pants, and then in them. He’s hard, you can feel his erection bucking against your thighs, against your ass, and to your shame you realize you’re hard too. *~*TEXT*~*

In Bruce’s eyes, Tony’s charm outweighed his brattiness. “Fine, but we really need to hammer out the specifics of this system.” “ Hammer  you say?” Tony joked as he slicked Bruce’s entrance with lubricant then stretched his hole gradually with his fingers until it was ready for Tony to slide his cock deep inside. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The demon whined dramatically, grinding against Froze roughly. "Fruuoooooooze, I'm horny!! I wanna fuuuuck!!" She ground against the angel more, moaning softly as she teased the angel through her panties. The angel offered no response but to raise her waist a little higher, giving Yosafire free access to her. The demon grinned, excitedly pulling down Froze's panties before grinding against her roughly, before pushing inside roughly, taking the angel as she read. She offered no real response, though her breathing became slightly more ragged as the demon began to pound her out. Yosaf's tail thrashed, and she moaned loudly, ravaging the angel with all she had, moaning and panting, clutching her as she took her, Froze's lack of reaction only spurring her on more, causing her moans to grow louder. The angel turned her page, and Yosafire fucked her harder, her tail coiling around her own leg as she grew close, her cock throbbing before she pumped Froze full of cum, sighing happily as she pulled out. The angel sighed, and gently pulled up her panties, sitting down with shaky legs. That had taken more out of her than she'd expected. *~*TEXT*~*

Seconds later, her eyes go wide as realization hits. “I didn’t, I mean-“  “Say it again,” Villanelle orders. Eve is confused. Villanelle starts to move her fingers again at an agonizingly slow pace. “Say it again.”  Eve shudders as Villanelle’s fingers pick up speed. “Oh fuck daddy,” she moans. She’s close, she can feel the heat rising, and Villanelle only speeds up.   “Again.”  Villanelle curls her fingers. Eve tenses up. She clenches her eyes shut as she orgasms. “Yes, yes oh fuck yes daddy,” she whispers as she falls over the edge. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*With his hands and his mouth, Loki enjoys Thor’s erection. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Loki opened Thor’s fly like he was unwrapping a gift.  With intoxicating anticipation, Loki freed Thor’s cock from the fabric.  His fingers explored it, striving to leave no spot untouched.  He wrapped his lips around the tip and stroked the shaft.  He enjoyed the sensation of Thor’s hardness in his hand: the firmness of the flesh and the hot, silky skin…   Thor grabbed Loki’s head and began to thrust wildly into his mouth.  Soon Loki felt the gush of Thor’s come and he hurried to swallow, relishing the complex taste and the smooth feel of it sliding down his throat. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*This is a small vent work I wrote in like , 10 minutes . *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Vomit . The bathroom fucking reeked of vomit . But thats what happens when you jam two fingers down your throat , forcing yourself to gag over and over again until your stomach is empty . Clensed from those god-forsaken calories .   How long was this gonna go on ? How long could they survive while starving themself , or purging everytime they ate anything .  How long would it be until their heart stopped working , their brain shut down , their voice becoming broken and raspy from the acid fucking it over everytime they vomited .  How long until they died ? It's a mystery why they aren't dead already . 5'5 feet tall , weighing a mere 75 pounds , looking like a fucking skeleton .   How would they die ? heart failure ? iternal bleeding ? malnourishment ?   Maybe from their body caving in from how tiny they were .  Yet still , it wasn't enough . They didn't feel skinny enough . When would they be happy with their body ? would they ever be happy with it ?   They knew this was dangerous . It was stupid . Fucking stupid .   But they didn't care . Nothing mattered to them . Nothing but being skinny . And if they died trying , so be it *~*TEXT*~*

"I thought that was your job," Jack murmurs, scraping rough nails down his back. "Riding my cock like-"  "You're an ass- Fuck, Jack," he mumbles, face buried in Jack's neck. "I'm- I'm coming."

*~*TEXT*~*It’s almost endearing how Shouto’s eyes stay glued to the same spot on the mirror in front of them, stuck on the reflection of Enji’s cock fucking in and out of his little hole as Enji slowly moves his son up and down in his lap.  “Do you like it?” Enji murmurs in Shouto’s ear, giving a hard thrust upwards, watching rapt was Shouto’s eyes almost flutter closed, almost stop looking –  almost  but not quite. “You like watching your father fuck you?”  “ No ,” Shouto denies, even as he squirms on Enji’s cock, flushing when Enji laughs at him, mocking.  “ Liar. ” *~*TEXT*~*

Meanwhile Taeyong tongued at your hole in between your plush ass cheeks. It was all too much, stimulated from both ends. The foreign feeling of Tae’s hot; wet tongue licking at your most private of areas and Jaehyun’s thick dick slowly entering you. He dipped his hips low and brought the curve of his dick to push up against your g-spot.  You squeaked and tugged on Tae’s hair tighter, “ Oh my fucking God .” Taeyong started to get messy with it. The combination of your slick and his saliva smeared all over his cheeks. He didn’t seem bothered by it and continued, adding his index and middle finger into the mix. *~*TEXT*~*

He lapped at the tip for an instant before taking the entire length beyond his lips.  Tony drove faster.  The air rushed by them.   Bruce raised and lowered his head at a painfully slow pace.  Tony groaned with frustration as Bruce teased him.  When he could stand it no longer, Tony drove with one hand on the wheel so he could shove Bruce down and release violently into his mouth. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Loki failed to repress his erection as Valkyrie restrained him. “Seriously?” she asked when she noticed the bulge in his tight leather pants. “What?” Loki replied nonchalantly. Valkyrie rolled her eyes and reached to extricate his hardness from the leather. “Oh that,” Loki breathed as she wrapped her hand around it. “Yeah, that.” Loki thrust his hips hopefully, but she didn’t move her hand. “Say please.” He was cranky at her demand, but eager; he said it.  She jerked him mercilessly, chains rattling, and it was only a moment before she had milked a shuddering orgasm from his bound body. *~*TEXT*~*

Thor’s massive hand was around Tony’s erection, pumping furiously.   “Let me ride you,” Tony demanded. “This floor is disgusting,” Thor protested. “I’ll take your clothes to my dry cleaner,” Tony assured him, “just fucking lay down.” Thor grinned, then obeyed. Tony straddled him and rode him hard, slamming on and off his cock until Thor couldn’t help but release deep into him with a ferocious growl that was far too loud for a public place. *~*TEXT*~*

The hot metal burned your skin through the flannel that had been hastily laid out for you to lay against. Your hands were in his hair and your ankles latched behind his back. His one hand behind your head holding you up against him and his other between your legs, fingers ravaging your clit. With one final thrust, a bite to your neck, and a savage twist of his fingers you came undone, clinching around him, throwing him into his own orgasm as you shook, walls fluttering around his pulsing cock. “If I had known how much you really liked this car, I’d have stolen it from Dean a lot sooner.” He grinned down at you while he pulled his jeans up before helping you off the hood. “Well, we’ll just have to do the grocery shopping from now on.” Now, if you could only remember what it was you were supposed to be picking up from the store. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*They didn’t speak. Loki pressed his lips to Tony’s throat, surreptitiously inhaling his scent.  Soon they were naked, and Tony was guiding himself inside.  Loki kept his face guarded.  Tony smirked down at Loki as he fucked him.     In the last moment, Loki forgot to hide; he smiled broadly as he splattered his chest, gazing dreamily into Tony’s eyes. At the sight of Loki’s vulnerability, Tony was overcome with need.  He swooped down and devoured Loki’s mouth as he shot deep into him. Afterwards they said nothing, only dressed, and folded inside themselves the soft, secret feelings shared between them. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The deep snow cushioned his fall when Edward pushed him to the ground. He didn’t struggle as his trousers were pulled down, exposing his bare ass and privates to the bitterly cold air. A gloved hand grabbed his soft cock, tugging it till it hung red and engorged between his thighs. His cheeks were parted and an unbearably cold liquid was forced into him by an ungloved finger, the heat of his body warming it as the finger moved inside him. Removing his finger, Edward parted him, exposing his small little pucker. Nikolai moaned and writhed as first the head, then the shaft, painfully stretched his tight hole. He bit his gloved hand to keep from crying out as Edward sank, ball deep, into him. Slowly, Edward started to move, Nikolai lying motionless as Edward thrust into him as slowly as he could.  "Next time, I choose place!" Nikolai growled from under the bear skin he shared with Edward, the two in each in each other's arms in the abonded barn they'd found.  "Next time, it vill be MY turn!" Edward kissed him playfully. *~*TEXT*~*
