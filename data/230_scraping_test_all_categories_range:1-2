*~*SUMMARY*~*Emma is working a mystery that leads to a Tattooed Lady. (snippet scene) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*"Not to my tastes for myself," Emma said, even as she accepted the invitation to inspect the art on the Tattooed Woman's back. "But I can admire those who take the time to endure the process, and become a canvas of art for posterity."  "I suppose in your line of work, it would mark you out too much."  "Indeed." Emma studied the most recent additions, and what she'd been looking for. "Thank you, miss. Your latest artist did leave a clue for me in this."  "Glad to help," the woman answered, before pulling her robe on and seeing Emma out. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“You don’t strike me as a criminal.” Viktor stated, his tone surprisingly calm and collected for someone who just witnessed their boyfriend order two men to ‘deal with someone.’  Jia glanced up from the paperwork on his desk, his magenta coloured eyes meeting the Russian’s maroon ones. His face adopted a lazy smile, leaning back in his chair slightly. “Well,” Jia purred. “That’s what makes me so good at it.”  Viktor paused. He inhaled, slightly taken aback at how laidback the Asian was about the whole situation. How calm and lax he was. Like it was all normal.  The worst thing, however, was that Viktor knew that Jia was right. *~*TEXT*~*

Anyone could just spot you walking in an alley and report you to the police!"  "Why're you so stupid?!" Ray scolded.  "H-hey Ray..." Zack walked towards Ray, wrapping his arms around her.  Ray sniffled into Zack's hoodie.  "Wh-what.."  "What am I to do i-if you're not around?" Ray sobbed.  "How can I take care of myself when you're not here?"  She hugged Zack.  "I-I'm sorry, alright?" Zack pushed his nose into her golden hair.  He put his fingers under her chin and lifted her head up so that she was looking at him. He had to say something to lighten up the mood.  He stared into her blue eyes.  "Wanna get something to eat?"  Ray smiled and nodded.  "O-of course *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Idk, felt like writing something for the fandom. Might write more. I don't really like Angel. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Angels' chosen to ignore the lack of a collar, bitter as it makes her. They put around her neck a pink ribbon. She's had such before, it's not new. She should feel happy to have it, wag her tail, look cute, but she can't bring herself to.   Everyone around her has a collar, older, younger, they all bear it. She does not.  These people – Jim dear and Darling. They talk to her like a puppy. Like a child. Like she's some young dog. She hates it, bares teeth at it, then is reminded this is her last shot.  Angel doesn't believe a chance will come after this. Angel knows her luck.  She can't go back to Buster now, either.  She hears talk, people speak of money and coins. She's seen the flat, shiny objects, they mean nothing to her or dogs, but she knows they effect how many things a person can have, dogs included.  Still, she feels she should be grateful.  But Angel also feels she can't trust these people. *~*TEXT*~*

Deltas glare from the dark with shining eyes, A clowder of cats, a pack of wolves. Deltas come and go as they please Don’t ask them where they’ve been. Deltas are hellions and goblins, they are the moon, They are the color red, they are poisonous flowers. Deltas are women, sisters, daughters, Deltas answer to none. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*David hadn’t made up his mind on what to think of Racer. The other guys seemed to have warmed up to him, but Racer was a mystery.  He hoped that would change, but the strike had been over for a couple of weeks and he still was no closer to the blonde.  “I really should go home.” David told Jack, even as he followed the other boy to the Boarding House.  “Nonsense!” Jack replied, “Stay for a bit.  We’ve all been to yours, but you’ve been been to where we live.”  David didn’t bother arguing as Jack pulled him into the building.  “Kelly, you’re later than usually,” Mr. Kloppman greeted. Turning his gaze to David, he asked, “Who’s the boy with the big head?  He looks like a toothpick with a watermelon on top of it.”  Racer, who had been coming down the stairs, burst out laughing.  When he noticed the blank looks on Jack and David’s face, he asked, “Are we going to pretend that wasn’t funny?”  “Were are you going?” Jack asked as the blonde headed back to the door.  “I’ll be back by bell.” was all the younger boy said before closing the door behind him. *~*TEXT*~*

She looked amazing, so much lighter than did with the pressure of of school and the war on her.  “I don’t get it,” George took a gulp of his fire whiskey, “two red-headed gods and she picks Oliver Wood.  Maybe she feels sorry for him”  “No,” Fred replied as Hermione threw her head back, laughing at whatever the rising Quidditch star had said, “she doesn’t know him the way we do.”  “She looks happy.” George responded, “Happier than I’ve ever seen her.”  “Well, she no longer has to get Ronald passing grades.” Fred laughed dryly, “They look good together.”  “We gotta make sure he doesn’t screw this up.”   “That’s asking a lot,” Fred grinned, “Remember the last one?”  “None of his past girls were anywhere close to Hermione’s caliber. She’s special, unique.”  “Terrifying.”  “Beautiful.”  “Intelligent.”  “Funny.”  “Everything he could want.” Fred nodded, “Yup, he will definitely need our help.”  “Tomorrow.” George responded, the twins watching as Hermione left the room and Oliver followed right her. *~*TEXT*~*

But he had somehow managed to snag a date AND maintain a relationship with Katherine Pulitzer and he had no idea what to get her for Valentine’s Day, which is how he ended up at Spot and Racer’s apartment.  “Spot once gave me a five-pound box of candy on Valentine’s Day anonymously.” Race said, pouring a cup of coffee.  “I never sent you a five-pound box of candy.” Spot’s forehead creased in confusion.  “You didn’t?” Race turned to face his long-term boyfriend.  “No.” Spot glared at his coffee cup, “I didn’t.”  “Then I must be engaged to the wrong man.” Race smirked, laughing brightly as Spot turned his glare to the blonde.  Turning back to Jack, he said, “As long as it comes from your heart, she’ll love it.  My favorite gift Spot ever gave was the song that he wrote for me.  Just think about it.”  Jack was silent for a minute before it dawn on him.  He shouted a quick goodbye before he ran out of the apartment. *~*TEXT*~*

Jack had asked to meet him at the local coffeehouse, he had something to discuss with him.  When they sat down, he laid out his plan. He was going to run for Congress as an unapologetic progressive, he just needed Race’s help.  “So,” Jack leaned forward, looking for any sign of what the blonde was thinking, “What do you say?”  “I think you should.” Race nodded, “I think ambition is good. I think overreaching is good.  I think giving people of vision of government that’s more than social security checks and debt reduction is good.  I think government should be optimistic.”  “So I can count on you?” Jack asked, “If I’m gonna succeed, I need your help.”  “I’m in.” Race nodded, “Do you have others in mind or do you need me to recruit?”  “You’re the one with the connections in politics.” Jack replied, “I trust your judgement.”  Race nodded, already making the list of what they needed and who was best to do it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*No one expects Yellow to be  soft . She's a Diamond, after all Yet, Yellow is particularly... prickly. She's in charge of their armies and the defense of their empire. She has no use for small talk or wasted time. Only with her fellow Diamonds did she bend even a little. These days, that meant she only had Blue. Pink was... gone and White might as well be, with the way she stayed in her head. Even all these millennia later, Blue still found pretexts to shirk her duties so she could go and mourn Pink. This time, Yellow found Blue at Pink's Zoo. In her efforts to talk Blue into getting rid of the last vestiges of Pink, Yellow's own grief and guilt overcame her for a moment. If not for their Pearls, Yellow might have let herself give in to those feelings. Instead, she pushed them away, like she always did. *~*TEXT*~*

When Jack didn’t leave, he sighed and closed the book, “What’s on your mind?”  “What are you doing with Spot Conlon?” Jack spit out.  “Why do you care?” Race raised an eyebrow, keeping his relaxed position.  “He’s at the top of my crumb list!” Jack exploded, “In fact, he’s at the bottom of my crumb list, too.  And he’s every crumb in between!”  “Just because you don’t like him, doesn’t mean I can’t spend time with him.” Race shot back, glaring at the older boy, “You don’t control me.”  “Tony, he’s not a good guy.” Jack pleaded.  “Maybe that’s my decision to make.” Race shot back, re-opening his textbook, he said, “You can go now.”  Jack opened his mouth to argue but thought better of it, closing the door behind him and heading back to his own room. *~*TEXT*~*

They took everything away from him.     …     “knock… knock.” His baritone voice creaked from disuse. As if they would answer. Buttercups swirled around him.  At the back of his mind, a high, childish voice echoed,  Whos there?  Laughter.     He missed them so much. His angel, his queen. His sweetheart.     “flower.” Maybe his mind really was gone forever.     ...     Flower, who?     “flower you today?” Sans paused, his sobs coming in short gasps.     “… sweetheart…?”     And Frisk laughed.     ...please…    And Sans knew, whatever happened, his wish would always be the same.     ...come back...     He would trade all his tomorrows for one more yesterday.     ...please... *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Luke sat there with an expectant look as his bandmates blinked back at him.  “Home videos don’t sound like an awful idea.” Maggie tried to be helpful.  Everyone groaned as Luke lit up, “Any monkey can shoot a home movie.  I pride myself on shooting home films.”  The other band members shot pleading looks to Rachel, who sighed as she set her pencil down.  Sitting down next to Luke, she patted his hand, “Yeah, but honey, you always just take things a little too far.”  “No, I don’t.” Luke laughed.  “Okay,” Rachel nodded, “Your nephew’s first birthday.”  “That’s not fair.” Luke frowned as Theo and John tried to hold in their laughter.  “You brought a wind machine.” Rachel fix him with a look.  “To be fair, my vision was-” Luke tried to defend his decision.  “Honey,” Rachel tucked her hair behind her ear and took his hand, “You brought a wind machine.”  “Who puts wheels on a crib?!” Luke exclaimed, his eyes wide and Rachel got up and went back to her homework, Theo watching her walk away.  “So,” John pressed forward, “who has another idea?” *~*TEXT*~*

Not even soda.  How am I supposed to be awake with it?!” Race replied before trailing off and mumbling in Italian.  “Surely it’s not THAT important.” Katherine replied, still getting used to the group of boys she had befriended.  “I love it more than anything.” Racer replied, his voice flat and face more serious than Katherine had ever seen it.  “What about Spot?” Mush laughed.  “I love espresso, coffee, caffeinated teas, and Spot.  In that order.” Race replied.  Seeing the looks of disbelief on friend’s faces, he added, “He know!”  “Got your text.” Albert slid into his desk next to Racer, setting the large coffee in front of the other boy.  “This is why you’re my favorite.” Race grinned at the redhead. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Judge not, lest ye be judged. Dumbledore and Harry, at Kings Cross. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Albus Dumbledore had sent his protege out to be the sacrifice; he hadn’t expected Harry to return as an avenging angel. In Death, the child fairly blazed with power - never mind that he, shiftless student that he had been in life, had never done anything to deserve it.  The pitiless green of Harry’s eyes looked back at him. “And whose fault was that, Professor? You had a hand in it, too.”  Albus fought down a sob, as three more figures stepped out of the fog towards him.  “The only ones you ever feared.” Harry’s voice! Like glass edged with gilt.   “But you know what they say about glass houses,” said Harry, and this time his voice was a hailstorm.  Albus covered his ears and very nearly wailed aloud.   “Even after all this time, you can’t face your family?” whispered Harry, in the barest caress. Then with that touch of kindness, he turned and boarded the train, whose doors closed silently behind him.  Albus, at last, looked up to meet his fate. *~*TEXT*~*

He missed hugs, cuddles, kisses and of course he missed sex too.  "I feel the same. Your t-shirt feels nice but it's not you." Wearing his t-shirt to bed, rehearsals and where ever he could get away with it was only doing him so much good. The bottle of Brian's cologne he'd stolen was running low.  "You owe me a birthday present. I hope you got something good." Brian teased though he was mostly serious.  "I love you Johnny. Good night."   Tomorrow they'd see each other again and the world would feel right once more. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*When Lily Carew was seventeen, she decided she must have an affair with a man.  She had considered the advantages and disadvantages carefully. A lost hymen may lead to an awkward conversation on a wedding night, depending on the husband, but Lily had plans for her life that, while they did not exclude marriage, did not necessitate one, either.  Perhaps, in retrospect, she had been hasty in her methods. He was one of those men who came to see her father late at night bearing parcels and guns, who she wasn't supposed to see or acknowledge. Harry wasn't much older than she was, and he, too, knew he wasn't supposed to notice young Miss Carew as she skulked about on top of the stairs.  In the end, it was almost too easy to tempt him to come to her, and then come up another flight and into the shelter of the thick walls of her bedroom.  "How-- Was it all right?" he asked afterwards, panting from his exercise.  Educational , thought Lily, who had noticed how his pupils changed and his throat flexed as he came.  She smiled, snuggling down on her side of the pillow. "Perfectly lovely." *~*TEXT*~*

My friend, our time I would soon be taking. As I stood atop the roof, my heart cried. Below, you sobbed like levies were breaking. When I hit the concrete, your spirit died.  I could save your dear life, but not my own. I'm sorry, my friend, I left you alone. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The sterekdrabbles challenge for 02/04/19: “threaten, brave, swap” I don't remember any references to study hall at Beacon Hills High. When I was in high school study hall was in the school auditorium, so that's where I set this piece of silliness. Derek's status as alpha and Stiles's as omega, on the A/B/O spectrum, are merely incidental. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“Scott! Swap seats with me!” It took a few seconds for Stiles’s request to pierce the haze in Scott’s head. Studying was hard. “ Why? ” “I need to be on the aisle when — I just need that seat!” Derek Hale, new kid in school, was an alpha, with chiseled jaw, threatening glare, eyebrows of doom. Stile’s little omega heart, and certain other organs, hadn’t stopped throbbing since his arrival. Now ambling up the auditorium aisle, he’d pass Stiles in ten, nine, eight… Stiles braced himself.

*~*TEXT*~*"You really thought you'd get away with faking it?"  Tompa flinched. He'd been afraid of me since the beginning of the Hunter Exam; since I drank that soda and didn't shit my guts out. Still, he managed to retort, "What are you talking about?"  I went over to him. "Let me show you..."  He tried to get out of the chains he'd pretended to put on himself, but I was faster. I grabbed the cuffs and snapped them closed. Then, I looked back to the rest of the group. "There's no point in choosing O. Soon, there'll be only three of us anyway."  Leorio grabbed an axe from the wall. I laughed and put the other set of chains on myself.  "See you after the exam, Gon."  [O:5 X:0] *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*There is a boy who bleeds in line to inherit an Empire. The stars are going out. There are places to hide a son. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*An hour drops. A second slips. There is a flaw in Her Renewed Majesty. The horologists know, and do not observe.   One among her number is unwinding. Like the stars, the royalty’s coming undone. Her son had a son and the poor boy cannot stop bleeding; prick him with a needle and he’ll empty to nothing at all. “Does she have it, in ‘er blood that’s all covered in hours?” the Urchins cry. “Would all time go, if we put a wee scratch into ‘er?”  This will not stand. The Monarchy can withstand the wrath of infernal armies. It cannot endure this kind of gossip for long. A solution will have to be found, and the one that stands out is radical— but then isn’t it true that the radicals won, in the end?  The stars have gone out. There are so many places to hide a son...  Far in the sky the Unbleeding Tsarevich sleeps. He’ll inherit an Empire, some day. We hope we’ll sort things out before it comes.  In a sky, a star shines bright unred. “We do not know what the Tsarevich weeps!” its acolytes cry. “But it is not blood! It is NOT blood!” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Derek’s arms and torso were bound with soft rope and he was kneeling on the floor.  Stiles sat down on the edge of the bed. “Look at you,” he said softly, smiling. “So perfect for me, my good boy.”  Derek’s chest filled with pride, even as his cheeks burned. He was torn between shame and joy, he was an alpha werewolf, he shouldn’t like to submit like that, it wasn’t  normal . But on the other hand, he loved letting go, loved how free he felt, knowing Stiles would take care of him.  “For you,” he said quietly. “Your good boy.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Derek watched the handlers lead the slaves to the display cages, and as soon as the saleswoman showed up he approached her.  “Number 6,” he said.  She looked at the snarling werewolf clawing at his silver collar, and when she looked back Derek raised an eyebrow and impatiently tapped the stack of money in his hand.  It was almost half an hour later before they were in the car, driving away.  “It’ll be okay, Stiles,” Derek said, “I’ll fix this.”  He hoped he was right as Stiles growled and snapped after him from where he was chained to the backseat. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*It's almost full moon and Remus is getting increasingly stressed. Almost...wolf-like. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Whining pitifully, Remus scrabbled and tore at his clothes, neck stretched toward the moon, enticing it to play. He looked elegant in the half-light, the rings around his eyes not so telling and the scars not so fresh.  He tore viscously at his clothes, nails digging into hot flesh. He ached to be touched.  Then he heard it. That, low, throaty whining. The heat in his stomach pooled intensely, coiling and twisting in his stomach with such an intense burn that he almost couldn't bear it. It was time.  With shaking fingers he pulled the door open.   "Sirius-" He breathed. *~*TEXT*~*

I'm tired and I just wanna go home and shower." Gabe was silent for a moment.  "I'm just sayin, kiddo. IN this line of business you have to be a little...aggressive and I know that's never been who you are but I care about you and I don't want to see you hurt. That's all I'm sayin." I didn't respond.

*~*TEXT*~*“It doesn’t have to hurt, sweet thing,” Astrid cooed. Softly, almost soothingly, like she didn’t have a knife pressed against Nadine’s throat. “Do as I say, and I don’t have to use this.” The dagger’s cold metal burned like a brand against Nadine’s skin. She struggled to keep her breaths steady, to centre herself, sight obscured by the blindfold. She knew she was only ever one word away from safety, but it didn’t stop her heart from pounding like a battledrum in her ears. “First of all,” Astrid said, her voice liquid silk, “you can tell me why you disobeyed.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Forgive me, for I have Sinned.” Cor’s low voice intoned before he kissed the mark he’d left high on Ignis’ throat. A muffled laugh was his reward, “You’re ridiculous.” “You love me anyway.” He would never understand how he’d won over this incredible man. But seeing those happy, satisfied green eyes looking back up at him, made his heart  ache  with love. A wry smirk graced Ignis’ face just before he spoke, “I confess that I really, really do. I love you very much. Though, I’m not sure how I’m supposed to go over accounts with the King in the morning with this rather prominent souvenir.” He ran his fingers lightly over the mark on his neck, “Noctis will heckle me over it all day long.” Cor snorted, “I’m sure he’ll have his own from another blonde we all know and love.” “Quite.” Ignis chuckled and leaned up to slide his arms around Cor’s neck and pull him back down for more kisses, “A matter for the coming sun. I’m not done with you yet this night, my Immortal.” Cor made a pleased sound and dove back in for more. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"For me?"  "For you."  Lucius held up the small black box, lid up and open to reveal the white leather collar inside that lay on a black silk cushion. The collars buckles were silver and polished perfectly. A tag was attached to the front buckle, Severus's and Malfoys name engraved in it, besides the Tag was an equally shiny bell, ready to ring with the  slightest  movement.  Severus gulped, swallowing the lump in his throat, bought on by a strange emotion he had yet to discover; He felt grateful to the pureblood.  Grateful! For a collar!   His dark eyes, encased in black circles bought on by a lack of sleep, slowly lifted to meet Malfoy's pale ones.  "Why?" Snape simply asked, voice lacking (or refusing to hint at,) any emotion.  Lucius's lips pulled up into a smirk, some hidden agenda behind them, but there always was something deeper with him then there was on the surface.  "Becuase you're my  good boy ." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Rodney McKay spent his last moments alive feeling disgusted and embarrassed because I kissed Carson Beckett. He understood, he forgave me instantly, not wanting me to die unforgiven, but; he still died feeling skin crawling grossed out because I kissed his best friend, with his body.”  Laura Cadman was the exception at the table. It was girls poker night but it stopped being poker night over an hour ago, when Kate pulled out a bottle of Zelenka's rotgut moonshine that they cut into increasingly smaller portions of Gangu’ua juice. It wasn’t the best mixed-drink if you were judging by the taste, but they weren’t drinking for the buzz tonight.   Laura lifted her hand, scratching at the back of her neck, shivering when she scraped the short hairs at the back of her neck instead of catching whispy strawberry blonde hair.   “You know, I never regained consciousness. My body, never regained consciousness. It fell to the floor, and three hours later, flatlined.” Laura reached for the bottle, topped off the shot glass sitting by her, and the night got blurry while she drowns the pain. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Red hooded eyes stare up at him, Derek completely lax on the mattress. Stiles tugs on the collar, making sure it’s not too tight and not too loose. Derek lets out a low whine, jutting his hips up against Stiles’s.  Stiles chuckles and shakes his head. “Not yet, love.” Derek only blinks at him, not understanding a word. Then he reaches up and nuzzles into the juncture of Stiles’s neck, huffing and licking at the skin. “Such an impatient sourwolf.”  Stiles abruptly shoves Derek back down and presses their lips together. Derek growls as Stiles ruts against him, rumbling back. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*My second January Jaunt drabble for AJenno. Her prompt was  knotting.  *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Pressing himself against Derek’s chest, Stiles felt sweat between them, and something like a baseball in his rectum. (Being the analytical type, he liked precise comparisons.) After his third orgasm he also felt a bit detached, mentally at least, from the proceedings. Derek, non-verbal, managed only grunts, exhalations both sudden and slow. Stiles reached behind, nesting his fingers in Derek’s sweaty hair. “So if I conjure up a knot on my dick, then I can knot you?” he asked. A deep, drawn out, “ Mmmm ,” meant Derek had either climaxed again or else he was agreeing. Stiles decided Derek was agreeing. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*On Discord the drabble writers of Sterekdrabbles came up with a fic exchange, January Jaunt 2019. The recipient whose name I drew listed four prompts and I decided to write a drabble for each one. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*From their heart-shaped tub, Stiles watched his naked husband stalk around dimming lights, the perfect way to spend their honeymoon. No. Wait. Not perfect. “D’erk,” Stiles slurred. “Ya need t’ get in. Think I’m stuck in a ventricle.” Hopping gracefully into the tub, “How much champagne have you drunk?” Derek asked. “ Lots . Kiss me now.” Derek kissed him. “You taste like  Veuve Clicquot .” Stiles sighed. “You’re so smart. Married you ‘cause you’re so smart, ya know.” “I know.” After another kiss, “An’ ‘cause you got a great ass and bomb dick.” “I know, Stiles. You said that in your vows.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*the one where they lose their virginity *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*With the sheriff working overnight and Derek’s parents out of town, it’s Stiles and Derek’s first night alone since they began dating. Being virgins, their first time isn’t something they want to rush. Hands and lips press over exposed flesh as they slowly undress and once done, it’s as if their bodies are made for one another, fitting together perfectly. Inexperience is clearly  not  an issue as both give and take as needed. Harsh pants fill the air as they bring each other to completion before collapsing from exertion. They wake the next morning, still wrapped in each other’s arms.     *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It takes a surprisingly long time to get from the balcony to the bed, from kissing to what comes next. “Cain,” Lucifer whines, when Pierce bears down on him. “Cain.” “Samael,” Pierce counters, and Lucifer wails, wings unfolding from his back. Afterward, under the blanket of feathers, Lucifer speaks softly, in the rounded, heavy language of the time before Babel. What do you desire? Cain answers, sharp and tight-jawed.  To die. “That’s a different dialect,” Lucifer derails, in English again. “Where were you living, then? Sounds Eastern.” “Do you  ever  shut up?” Pierce growls, shoving Lucifer into the mattress again. *~*TEXT*~*

Instead, the space was filled with the screeching of chair legs, air passing through rapidly working lungs, and eventually a crash or two.  "You're paying for that," said Abby, kicking a piece of bent metal out from under her leg. She'd have to start the experiment all over again, but she could be mad about that later.  "I'll just steal one from the chem department."  "I knew there was a reason I loved you." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*January 29. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*There are words, words he should say, but as he looks up into Sherlock's face, eyes nearly closed, the ridiculously posh lips parted as he moves slowly above him, he knows anything he could say wouldn't be enough, not nearly enough, so he laughs, then covers his mouth with both hands as Sherlock glares down at him, but the lips quirk up in understanding.  As he well knows, the laughter is a symptom of joy, not of derision, and he leans closer and kisses him lightly, then whispers, "happy anniversary, John."  There is nothing more to be said as John's arms wrap around him tightly as he buries his face into John's neck and breathes him in, their separate scents have long fused together, though he can still remember, as he always remembers everything; a time before, a time before John, a time before he was loved, before he found he was capable of returning the love. John's arms tighten around him as he sobs, fingers lightly trace over the old scars and as he finally finds his voice whispers back, "happy anniversary, love." *~*TEXT*~*

She grabs the wand at the hilt and starts slowly massaging the oil into the wand, making sure not to be too rough.      “Yes Pansy, just like that. Don't forget the tip.”     She finishes rubbing down the wand and places it on the counter.      “Mr. Ollivander, I'm tired of polishing these wands, I thought you needed an apprentice to help you make them.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The line between hate and lust is a fine one. Both are so passionate, so full of fire. It consumes the soul and leaves every synapse burning, flames devouring the mind like rain eats snow. Intoxicated, a body led by impulses, where conscious thought departs, leaving only instinct and sensory overload in its wake. Causing tremors, tears, laughter, sweat. A curious phenomenon.  Fiery red, too, is the mane obscuring the centre between alabaster thighs. A sighed name crafting the whole universe passes through an opened mouth, dripping off of parted lips to pool in the valley of an uncovered chest, vulnerable. Patience, beautiful light, is the given command. Mumbled against intimacy, vibrations reign. A shudder. Ready to soar, but with Icarus in the back of her conscience. She leaps. Lest the flames scar her while she flies. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Quentin can tell that the figure of Tony Stark has made a home for himself in Peter's psyche, in his heart, and in his memory (loving as it is).  He can't wait to bend that over his knee. Bend that over his  will . *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Quentin knows how to read a room. (He also knows how to make that room read whatever he wants them to, put their easily-warped minds to the task, and draw whatever conclusion is convenient for him, but that’s neither here nor there.)     He knows about special effects and illusions and mindfucks. (And this Peter kid, what a  very special  effect he’s having on Quentin. What a mindfuck it is to find out the sweet boy he’s been screwing into every night since he saved him from the water elemental, is Spider-Man.)      Quentin gasps when he sees Peter’s name in one of the books listing the names of The Dusted and The Returned. Post-Decimation, they’d been printed and distributed in rural communities who couldn’t check the searchable masterlist online, including most of this part of northern Italy. The pages are thin like those in hotel room Bibles, near-transparent. (He wonders what sound Peter made as he was dying – was it like the way he sobs on Q’s cock every night?)     Or maybe it had been more like how Peter sounds when he’s asleep and Quentin invades his dreams instead of his hole. (“Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark, please,” Peter whimpers.)     Mysterio sighs. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Being born in one of the cruelest families of Demons, Min Yoongi has learned to have no mercy and to kill every obstacle that would possibly stop him from reaching his goals, especially Angels. He is convinced that love is made for the weak ones and nothing ever made him feel that way. That is until he meets Park Jimin on his journey to discover his real powers and how to use them. Little did he know that Park Jimin is actually an Angel in human’s skin who tries to lead him to something good. Something better. But when Yoongi finally finds out Jimin’s little secret, it’s already too late. He is way too much in love with him to fall back. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*A little snippet from what's about to come until I post the first chapter♥  "So pathetic," he says, tears forming at the end of his eyes "Look at us, Yoongi. We’re like magnets. We won’t fit next to each other but we balance everything like this. It’s suppose to be a good thing, right?" A sad smile forms on Yoongi’s face as he takes Jimin’s hand in his. "It is suppose to be, but it’s not. Not for me. Not for us, Jimin."  A sharply silence falls between them, giving Yoongi a few moments to take a deep breath and continue "We can’t change what’s already written for us, can we?" Tears are already falling smoothly on Jimin’s red cheeks before he could even say a word. It’s true. They both know it is. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Hey,  Well, so I‘m looking for this fic I was reading months ago. It was pretty angsty but beautifully written. So I remember Clarke being called (?) by the Grounders to avenge Lexa’s betrayal. I think Lexa was tied up to a „blood tree“ or something similar (I remember that the Grounder had a special name for the tree as all Commanders got executed there). Clarke should cut Lexa or kill her, I don‘t remember but then Clarke saved her and they retreated to a cave where Clarke treats Lexa’s wounds and they grew closer together. It was such a good read and nobody was able to help me out yet... I hope you have better luck! If not, I‘m sorry I took your precious time and appreciate your afford! *~*TEXT*~*

Strade had you hurting other people now.  She’s passed out by now, the screaming come to a halt as the drill shattered her kneecap, but you don’t notice, at least not until Strade’s hands clamp over your own. He’s warm, warms your trembling hands, and the slowly cooling blood that trips from them.   “She’s out.” He says this with a bit of a laugh, but it’s cut off with a look. Strade’s red in the face, a devilish smile, looking at you from under his lids. You know that look, know what it means.   Under that look you’re nothing more than a sheep for the slaughter, and you don’t move, frozen, as Strade comes, and takes, and takes.   His lips on yours, bloody hands fumbling with your pants, and then in them. He’s hard, you can feel his erection bucking against your thighs, against your ass, and to your shame you realize you’re hard too. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*"The queen that never was, the queen that never will be. I am Lara Dorren, daughter of Shiadal. Lady of Space, Traveler of Worlds, and, unwitting the Harbinger of Wars.

*~*TEXT*~*I was called many things in my time. Aen Saevherne, Lady of Space, Mistress of Magic, the Shining One, and, unwittingly, Harbinger of Wars.     I was the daughter of Tatianna Shiadhal Andomiél, called often Feainnewedd by my father, King of the Alder Folk; I was his Sun Child, his hope and the future of my people. In the end, I chose to be me eäte’dearme, “my dream of summer.” I am named Lara, the gull, the visionary, and the stranger. Where was I among all those titles? I don’t know. For a time I thought I was one or two of those things, for I thought this time and place I was in demanded me to choose. Now as I lay beside my newly born daughter and breathed my last, and saw that I was wrong.     I was all of those things at once. If only others had realized that. If only I had realized that.     I am Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal, the beginning of an end. My path is the path of Destiny, and this is my story. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Bruce binds the female reader to a Sybian. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Bruce strapped you to the Sybian nineteen minutes ago.  You know because the timer shows forty-one remaining.  Bruce has warmed your back with two riding crops, three switches, and one incredibly painful whip.  You came five times so far, the last three taking you in rapidly overlapping waves.  Now Bruce uses a soft, suede flogger.  He caresses your raw skin between strikes. Suddenly he turns up the Sybian.  You scream from the pleasure as it vibrates between your legs, pressing against your clit while its dildo whirls inside you. “Good girl,” he croons as your sixth orgasm shudders through you. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Bend over, Tony.” “ You  bend over, Bruce.” “It’s my turn,” Bruce declared. “Wrong.” “Tony, you fucked me yesterday.” “Yeah, but then you fucked me with the purple dildo.” “That isn’t the same.” “No, it counts. Now fucking bend over.” Bruce glared for an instant before smiling fondly.  In Bruce’s eyes, Tony’s charm outweighed his brattiness. “Fine, but we really need to hammer out the specifics of this system.” “ Hammer  you say?” Tony joked as he slicked Bruce’s entrance with lubricant then stretched his hole gradually with his fingers until it was ready for Tony to slide his cock deep inside. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Froze is doing her homework, but Yosafire can't wait. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The demon whined dramatically, grinding against Froze roughly. "Fruuoooooooze, I'm horny!! I wanna fuuuuck!!" She ground against the angel more, moaning softly as she teased the angel through her panties. The angel offered no response but to raise her waist a little higher, giving Yosafire free access to her. The demon grinned, excitedly pulling down Froze's panties before grinding against her roughly, before pushing inside roughly, taking the angel as she read. She offered no real response, though her breathing became slightly more ragged as the demon began to pound her out. Yosaf's tail thrashed, and she moaned loudly, ravaging the angel with all she had, moaning and panting, clutching her as she took her, Froze's lack of reaction only spurring her on more, causing her moans to grow louder. The angel turned her page, and Yosafire fucked her harder, her tail coiling around her own leg as she grew close, her cock throbbing before she pumped Froze full of cum, sighing happily as she pulled out. The angel sighed, and gently pulled up her panties, sitting down with shaky legs. That had taken more out of her than she'd expected. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Sometimes words slip out at the worst times. Sometimes it works out in your favor though. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Eve whimpers. Villanelle’s fingers curl inside of her. She meets her lover’s blackened eyes. “More, please,” Eve begs.   Villanelle obliges and adds a third finger inside.   Eve is close. So so close. She wraps her arms around Villanelle’s neck, pulling her in for a kiss. “Fuck,” she groans. “Please daddy.”  Villanelle freezes. Eve whimpers. Seconds later, her eyes go wide as realization hits. “I didn’t, I mean-“  “Say it again,” Villanelle orders. Eve is confused. Villanelle starts to move her fingers again at an agonizingly slow pace. “Say it again.”  Eve shudders as Villanelle’s fingers pick up speed. “Oh fuck daddy,” she moans. She’s close, she can feel the heat rising, and Villanelle only speeds up.   “Again.”  Villanelle curls her fingers. Eve tenses up. She clenches her eyes shut as she orgasms. “Yes, yes oh fuck yes daddy,” she whispers as she falls over the edge. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Loki opened Thor’s fly like he was unwrapping a gift.  With intoxicating anticipation, Loki freed Thor’s cock from the fabric.  His fingers explored it, striving to leave no spot untouched.  He wrapped his lips around the tip and stroked the shaft.  He enjoyed the sensation of Thor’s hardness in his hand: the firmness of the flesh and the hot, silky skin…   Thor grabbed Loki’s head and began to thrust wildly into his mouth.  Soon Loki felt the gush of Thor’s come and he hurried to swallow, relishing the complex taste and the smooth feel of it sliding down his throat. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Vomit . The bathroom fucking reeked of vomit . But thats what happens when you jam two fingers down your throat , forcing yourself to gag over and over again until your stomach is empty . Clensed from those god-forsaken calories .   How long was this gonna go on ? How long could they survive while starving themself , or purging everytime they ate anything .  How long would it be until their heart stopped working , their brain shut down , their voice becoming broken and raspy from the acid fucking it over everytime they vomited .  How long until they died ? It's a mystery why they aren't dead already . 5'5 feet tall , weighing a mere 75 pounds , looking like a fucking skeleton .   How would they die ? heart failure ? iternal bleeding ? malnourishment ?   Maybe from their body caving in from how tiny they were .  Yet still , it wasn't enough . They didn't feel skinny enough . When would they be happy with their body ? would they ever be happy with it ?   They knew this was dangerous . It was stupid . Fucking stupid .   But they didn't care . Nothing mattered to them . Nothing but being skinny . And if they died trying , so be it *~*TEXT*~*
