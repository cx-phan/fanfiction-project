And the things we're drawn to,  because of its beauty,  turns into the most horrid of things.     Be careful,  to whom you judge,  you never know,  when someone might say the same things,  about you.     Beauty is only skin deep.  The soul,  is what will forever remain the same.     Our differences,  are what define us,  even through all the vanity. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The title pretty much says it all *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*This is total crack but: Dr Dolittle (or one of his decedents) arrives at Jurassic World. Probably before the movie. Maybe they're part of a team to check to make sure the dinosaurs are being treated well. Maybe they work there. Heck, maybe Barry's last name is actually Dolittle. (And he's constantly amazed how well Owen gets the raptors despite the fact they can't speak to each other). The point is, being a Dolittle means all animals sound like they're speaking English. But these are dinosaurs, so they sound like they're speaking old English.  Maybe the T-rex is speaking like Shakespeare or the Apatosaurus talk like something out of Pride &amp; Prejudice. I have this really bizarre image of the raptors talking like pirates &amp; calling Owen captain.  This is utter crack and, as I can in no way write accents or dialects, I'm never going to write this. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Fic idea I got from a dream I had (Thought of before Legend of Kora came out) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*What if Sozin died with Roku (or maybe instead of).  They’d be no war so what would the characters be doing? Aang would probably still have run away but with less consequences. Katara would have had waterbenders to learn from in the south pole. It’s doubtful Ozai would be fire lord but would he be as bad as he was? And it’s very doubtful Toph’s life have changed at all.  I had a vague idea of there being some sort of evil organisation working in the shadows of all four nations (maybe started by Sozin) kind of like an evil order of the white lotus. Of course I can’t think of what else to do with it so it on the stories-I’ll-never-write pile. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*I like crossovers. I'm pretty sure I'm dating when I thought of this idea just by what shows/books I mention here *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*A Stargate team (SG13 might be a little cliché but lets go with it) finds out their members are a little unusual.   This is just basically an excuse to have a big crossover fic. I thought of it when I was reading a Xander joins the SGC story. So Xander (Buffy the Vampire Slaver) joins the SGC (Stargate SG1) sometime after graduation maybe. And on his team are a mutant (X-men) a witch/wizard (Harry Potter) an immortal (Highlander) and anyone else I can think of. I kind of wanted it to be with side characters or even original ones but I could never think of any situations for them to get in. No plot means no story so this remains on my never-going-to-write pile. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*David Xanatos from Gargoyles, Lex Luther from smallville(or wherever), Seto Kaiba from Yugioh, Tony Stark from the Iron man movies and Bruce Wane from either the Nolan movies or the animated series (and any other rich character from a fandom I can remember) are all a some high class party, all secretly bored out of their minds. Then some high tech thieves try to crash the party to rob/kidnap the people there. Cue the assembled heroes and villains to fight off the intruders while not letting on to the other guests their combined badassery.   This would be a good excuse for all sorts of shenanigans but I'm coming up blank when I try to think of details.  I’ll never write this not only because I don’t have an ending or even a plot but also because I don’t think I could actually write any of these characters convincingly. *~*TEXT*~*

The preacher smiled before he nodded. ''Reverend Amos Howell.''  There was something about Reverend Amos Howell that caused Kara to tense. She viewed a smile stretching. Revealing long teeth. She stepped back.  ''You're far from home?'' Reverend Amos Howell wished to know. Kara's grave was also going to be far from home.    THE END *~*TEXT*~*

Reverend Amos Howell smiled and nodded at Kara. He viewed her sitting.  Kara heard a strong accent. Southern? Kara struggled to remain awake as Reverend Amos Howell preached.

He ducked his head down and his hand meandered southward, spreading on the small of her back and steadying her, tethering her to him. She eased into his touch, humming, playing with the locks at his nape. His thumb stroked the soft dip of her hip over the layers of fabric.  "You were saying?"  Cassian could  hear  the smile in the insolent ring of her voice. Turning into nothing but thumping heart and tingling skin, he smiled against Jyn's lips. His exhale became her inhale. She tilted her head and her demanding lips recaptured his. Cassian melted into the kiss, his fingers sliding into her hair— He could stay like this forever, melting into her.  His comm beeped. Their bubble popped.  "Later."  She squeezed his hand on her way out.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“I love you.”   “I know you do,” Soonyoung replied, whilst peppering kisses across the love of his life’s face. His cheeks, his temples, his forehead. Anywhere he could manage to pucker his lips. Seokmin looked up at him with warm eyes and a precious smile. “Say it back then, Soonie.” Moonlight glinted in his eyes. He winked. “I love you. I love you. I love you,” he replied, moving his lips down from Seokmin’s forehead, peppering more kisses along the side of his face to finally connect them with his lips. The pair both leaned back and stared into profound eyes, completely captivated by the other’s gaze. This moment felt like forever. They were so in love. And  nothing  was going to change that.   Seokmin jolted awake and looked over to his best friend, laying on the bed across from him. His heart sank. He let out a heavy sigh.

*~*TEXT*~*He knows he shouldn’t have taken it, but he couldn’t resist. Mary doesn’t wear most of the makeup in her bag, as far as he can tell, and she definitely never wears the bold red lipstick he’s spreading on his lips now.  “Jack?”  He startles, dropping the lipstick. It clatters against the porcelain of the sink, leaving a red smear down the side.  “Sorry,” Sam says quietly. “I didn’t mean to scare you. I knocked.”  Jack ducks his head away, as if hiding will take back what Sam’s seen. “I didn’t hear.”  “That’s okay.” Sam’s voice is soothing and the strong hand that settles on Jack’s shoulder is equally so. “What are you doing?”  His stomach clenches nervously. “I... um...”  Sam glances down at the lipstick in the sink and the little plastic bag over other makeup on the counter. Jack’s only really messed with the foundation and lipstick so far.  “Where did you get those?” Sam asks, thumb rubbing slow circles on Jack’s shoulder.  “... stole them from Mary,” Jack whispers.  Sam nods and gives Jack’s shoulder a squeeze. “Put them back and we’ll run to the store. Get you some of your own.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"I love Shiro and Curtis but they could've been better portrayed," someone complains, and Curtis thinks that never would have happened because he's just a pawn in someone's game.  How can anyone love something that's so transparent?  Curtis wonders how anyone could love him. He's nothing but a shadow of a character, an insult to everyone and everything that matters. He's a husk, a worthless attempt at pandering, and he's got no excuses. He knows why he exists, why the Coalition made him what he is, but he doesn't have enough agency to scream the truth. He's just the guy in the background who got married off to the gay guy in hopes of getting to Coalition a prize.  No one should care about him. No one should give him the time of day.  He's not even human.  Shiro deserves better than someone without a soul. *~*TEXT*~*

He is thankful for the darkness concealing the blush he can feel spreading across his face, although he reasons Data will no doubt have sensed the rise in his skin temperature anyway. “And perhaps we could—uh—use the time to explore  exactly  the lengths your creator went to in making you appear human?” Bashir deliberately bumps his hip against Data’s crotch as he hops down from the edge of the console. *~*TEXT*~*

She massages absently at her own neck.  "Gold," Regina snaps, eyes narrowing. " Back off. "  He turns his head, and in that split-second, Regina feels a deeply penetrating chill run up her spine. A physical, traumatized reaction. Rumpelstiltskin had always been good about instilling fear in his teachings.  "… Of course, dearie."  A loud, colorful whirl of magical smoke. He's gone.  Or at least for the time being.  Well… at least now something's going right… Regina huffs, wiping again absently at her forehead. Blood trickles heavily from the Evil Queen's hairline. She only stares wordlessly, confounded at Regina who sighs and pull out a handkerchief from her dark gray blazer's pocket, dabbing and smearing crimson fluid.  "You're an idiot." Regina doesn't feel sorry for blurting this out, gazing over the Evil Queen's face as this mirror-like image begins to smile hesitantly. A person who looks so much like her. "Even if you're  me ."  "We  do  look good in red," the Evil Queen quips, smudging a bit of red on the pucker of Regina's lips.  *    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Tamsin was a teenager.  Or, she was a week old.  Or, she was thousands of years old.   She had never kissed anyone.  Or, she had done it countless times.  Except she hadn’t recovered memories from past lives yet. One night, Tamsin met a woman and desired something she couldn’t quite pinpoint.  But her body knew.  She felt a thrill inside.  It spread down her stomach to the space between her legs.  She felt herself getting wet, and gasped.  It was the first time that had happened, except once she experienced the sensation, she realized it wasn’t new at all.  Tamsin didn’t recall how to kiss.  She let the woman take control.  As Tamsin melted into their embrace, flashes of her past first kisses played across her mind like a movie.   When the movie played again in her next life, Tamsin would remember tonight’s first kiss as one of the best. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*            Jeremy hates clothes shopping.              Objectively, it’s one of the worst things in the world, next to public speaking. And guess who has a presentation next week?              Not only is it worth a quarter of his final grade, not only does the teacher not like him, but the presentation also comes with a “professional attire” requirement. And when Brooke saw him lay out a wrinkly, ill-fitting button-down shirt, needless to say, she flipped her lid.              Jeremy is so grateful to her for this. He really is. But after having to drive a half an hour to the nearest mall, getting caught in traffic, and then being herded into a stuffy mall, he’s feeling very, very cranky.              “Jeremy, you need a nap,” his Squip informs him, which Jeremy responds to by telling him to shut up.              He can muscle through a few hours of being at the mall if it means getting a good grade on his presentation. If it means making Brooke happy.              Brooke holds a shirt up against his shoulders.              “Aww, you look so handsome!” Brooke coos, brushing his bangs from his forehead.              He preens under the attention.              Yeah, he can do this. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Shinooka is dating her team’s coach, but the relationship is a well guarded secret.  [Kiss 13: Discreetly] *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Shinooka, the manager of the boys’ baseball team, is proud to say she has a girlfriend. However, she wouldn’t actually tell you who her girlfriend is, because their relationship is a secret.  You see, her girlfriend is Momoe, the coach of her team. Which means their relationship comes with a big age gap and a power imbalance and is skirting the boundaries of whether it is illegal or not. Even if it is illegal, she doesn’t care. She loves Momoe, and she never wants to leave her.  So she can’t tell people who she is dating, even if she wanted to. And this means that whenever they kiss, they have to make sure that nobody can see them.  Which means whenever they’re getting out the equipment before baseball practise and happen to find themselves alone, Shinooka reaches up and gives her girlfriend a discreet kiss.  Yeah, this relationship is definitely problematic, but Shinooka doesn’t care. She just wants to experience this for as long as she can.  She never wants this to end. *~*TEXT*~*

You have a brain, use it.”.  “But…..”.  “I didn’t raise you to act before you fucking think.” Reau snapped back with a scowl. “Why do you think some of the warriors listen to Tiberius and Bo-Katan?”.  Tib’s attention was dragged away from the bickering pair as Eli shifted a bit. “You were right.” Eli pointed out.  “No more trusting Sith Lords.” Tiberius said with a smirk which earned a nod. *~*TEXT*~*

"You don't even work somewhere dangerous and that burn is the size of half a dinner plate!”  "Sorry, ser" Pavel Chekov replied guiltily, trying not to wince from the pain of his injury, despite the fact that the doctor was being as gentle as possible. Bones was mainly all bark and no bite, unless you really got him angry. Thankfully though, he had a soft spot for the young Russian navigator.   “Never mind. Just…don't handle anything hot.”  Seeing the horrified look on the boy's face, he added “except your boyfriend. Handle him any way you like.”  His face brightened, and Bones found himself smiling back in spite of everything.   “Now go. And be careful next time.”  “I will, ser!”  Bones opened his mouth to add something more, but the boy was already running out of medbay, clearly excited about something. Shaking his head, Bones went back to his files with a soft smile playing on his lips.     *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*That last night... *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*If they only had the one night, there was no room for hesitation or doubt, no time for regret or worry. They had only this - Kai's fingers in Sei's hair, his lips on Sei's neck, his body pressed close in the greatest of need. Somehow they got to Sei's bed - in hindsight Sei was sure they should have fallen over something and maybe they did but he just hadn't brought himself to care or commit it to memory. Not in the way he was memorizing Kai's bold touches, little noises, and sheer hunger. Sei vowed not to forget a second of it, even when they got to parts that turned out gleefully awkward and ended in laughter - Sei certainly hadn't prepared to have anybody over and in his bed, after all. One night... and they more than made the most of it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Fitz isn't one to entertain guests. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Ezra was caught off guard when Aria knocked on his door for the very first time. He rarely had visitors, and his apartment was a dreadful mess.  He didn't answer, but watched her through the peephole. A vantage point he appreciated.   She waited. Preened her hair. Nervously looked around.  Eventually she left, and he relaxed.  Ezra poured himself a glass of scotch, and resumed admiring the walls plastered with newspaper clippings, typewritten prose, and fleshly photos of Alison DiLaurentis. If Aria ever were to discover his little obsession with her dead best friend...   He'd probably have to kill her, too. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He was told his lawyer was coming that day. He didn’t feel confident to talk to him yet, he needed some time to think what was next for him. After all, he killed a man and he knew he had to be punished. But he was so young and was so scared, he hadn’t had a good sleep in days and his mind was racing in a high speed that made his head ache. But he wanted to explain himself, even if he ended up in jail for the rest of his life. He needed to tell the truth, wishing someone would understand why did he take a life with his own hands. His hands where shaking, his eyes locked on them as if staring at them would make the room disappear.  He wanted to see the rest of BTS so bad, but they weren’t allow in, since Jungkook was now a dangerous person. It was funny, everyone who met him knew he would never do anything to hurt his members. Anyway, it seemed like he already did. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Suzaku asks Lelouch to spank him. Lelouch tries. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Lelouch runs one hand up the small of Suzaku's back while the other cups his ass. Even with the lights turned off, he can make out the figure of his lover: his tousled hair, his face pressed into the sheets.  "Are you sure you want this?" he asks, at which Suzaku lets out a breathy sigh.  "Yes, Lelouch. Please."  Putting his hands on Suzaku is nothing strange to him; he's grown accustomed to exploring every inch of his body with his fingertips, but hitting him is something else entirely.  When he hits Suzaku's ass, it is barely more than a light tap. His lover shivers beneath him, regardless, and he repeats the motion. Every time, he stops just short of outright smacking him — like his lover had asked of him.  Lelouch cannot bring himself to hurt Suzaku like this, after all. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Certain items shouldn’t be used on clothing. Chappy belongs in that category. Rukia’s kisses are tentative despite being stripped down to her panties and bra. Her pale skin gleams silver beneath the moonlight, backlit by the blossoming trees. A proper breeze will shake the petals down, upset the thick syrupy air but it never comes.   Orihime presses her nose into Rukia's hair as she peppers her neck with hurried kisses. Goosebumps line their exposed skin, but neither pulls away from their embrace to return indoors.   “I'm happy here,” Orihime whispers, squeezing Rukia until she gasps. “Ever made lingerie from blossoms?” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Whatever shall I do with you?” Roger asks, brushing a wayward tear from his squire’s face.   Alex’s wrists were already secured to the bedposts by the time the drugged wine started to take effect, stoking his arousal and reducing him to this shivering, whining mess.  “Anything you want, sir.”  He shudders from head to toe.  “Please.” The unraveling of Alex’s everyday composure is always a remarkable sight, like watching a fire consume a forest or a cliff face crumble into the sea.  Roger allows himself one more moment of silent admiration, strokes Alex’s collarbone and the racing pulse in his neck, before adopting a gently scolding tone: “Now, now.  Didn’t your instructors teach you to be specific? There are so many parts of you that I could kiss, or caress, or  fill … and in quite a few different ways, too.  Tell me what  you  want.”  Such a thing does not, of course, matter as much as Alex thinks it does, assuming that he is still capable of thinking at all.  “And tell me why, indeed, I should give it to you.”  Roger doesn’t even have to feign interest in Alex’s answer.  “Then I shall decide how much you truly deserve.” *~*TEXT*~*

Curtis thinks that it'll help him with all the guilt eating him from the inside out but it doesn't.  Curtis is a liar. He's a hack. He's a fraud. He's nothing but pain and misery on everyone around him.   Even Shiro.   Especially  Shiro.  Curtis doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound.   He has no voice, no name, no personality.   He's always been an empty shell.   Now he really is one.    *~*TEXT*~*

Lon’qu strains to hear the sounds of floorboards, finds none.  Only Libra’s breaths beneath him, soft noises that edge from his throat. Lon’qu kisses his jaw, moves his calloused hand below the sheets.  Another, bordering on a gasp. Libra’s neck twists, presses the side of his face into the splay of his hair, golden like cornsilk, like his well-loved rosary.  “Hush,” Lon’qu rasps, but doesn’t stay his hand. Libra nods absent, the world distant, blurry through the warm waters of his mind. Still cries out at the feel of Lon’qu on his delicate skin.  Lon’qu’s hands, hardened now from work rather than war. From the splitting of wood, careful tying of tomato plants to stakes. Hauling water from the well.  They fought two wars to come to this, fought death and gods and their own bodies, infested houses shot through with fear.  Libra keens, and Lon’qu catches it in his mouth, his chapped lips pressing soft.   I know,  he doesn’t say. Libra pants and shifts and understands. *~*TEXT*~*

There is nothing left to ask. She, Ellen, has committed the utmost sin in her books – she has given up. Given up trying to live, live and be bloody happy for each morning you open eyes. No.. instead she longing in her head for teenage infatuation, still seeing the death of unhinged teenager as her fault. Scarlett winces, approaching  mother.  It seems pretty obvious, where her own obsession with Ashley might come from – probably there is something wrong with their genetics, inherited like predisposition for depression is falling for idiot, for fantasies life – doesn’t matter whether the name is Ashley of Robbilard. There is nothing left to say, nothing to ask. There is cover not to be blown, and getting the hell out of here, out, out and out. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Pose for me baby!”  You do exactly that, laughing along with Nubbins as you pose dramatically alongside the corpse the two of you had just finished digging up to rob. Nubbins takes several photos in succession as you pose first over draped over the tombstone, and then another of you blowing a kiss as you show off the dead man's rings, now on your own hands.  After tossing the corpse back in the desecrated grave you turn to your boyfriend, “Ready to head home?”  Nubbins only comes closer to you, not answering at first, before coming closer to you as you watch with an eyebrow raised.  “How about we take some more...private photos?”  He reaches into his sash, pulling a private polaroid the two of you had taken in the house before.  “Not here!”  You shove him away, before giving a wink.  “ But once we’re back to the house, I might just think about it.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Dig up the roots, anointing in earthy sap.  Breathe the process of creation, exhaling the fulfilment of death.  Joseph reflects on his doings.      Peace is distilled in the water turned from wine, the reversal bitter but necessary.   Golden prophecies rust in waning sunlight; die on the bronzing tongue.  ‘‘Don't speak,’’ she whispers, and the silence becomes a prophecy of it's own.     Prayer is in the breath.  Death becomes life, and what comes of it is eternal.   ‘‘There. Now, ascend,’’ her hands wreath around his throat and chest.      Inhale, hold, and exhale.   The living, the waiting, the dying. There is more.  Sin wades, tides over. Rebirth is in the sea-foam, crystallising on the shore.     ‘‘Pass on from this,’’ she instructs. ‘‘Pass on.’’  Joseph opens his eyes, and the eclipse dissolves.    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Minjun hummed with satisfaction when he finished buckling the collar around Hoon’s throat.  He slipped two fingers underneath the band and tugged at it lightly to test the slack, grinning when he saw the goosebumps break out on Hoon’s neck and felt the motion of Hoon’s gulp against his fingers.  Minjun let his palm rest there against Hoon’s neck, half of it under the collar. He could feel it when Hoon swallowed again, could feel the movement of that throat against his skin, and he thought about how much better it would feel if he pressed down, tightened his grip a little more.  Minjun decided he liked that thought. He liked it  a lot  .   “Not too tight, right?” he asked, and Hoon shook his head like he’d complain even if the collar were tight enough to asphyxiate him.  They both knew he wouldn’t, of course. That’s what made this fun. *~*TEXT*~*

Nevertheless, one unblinking, stone-faced Gibbs-glance had Mammy slowly backing away, not daring to voice her disapproval.   The look on her beloved Scarlett’s face had been pure Solange Robillard, just before doling out punishment in earnest; Mammy’s back tinged in memory and stomach rolled in cold fright. Solange and something else, equally frightening, but fleeting impression of Solange had been more than enough to retreat in home. *~*TEXT*~*

The fear and pain of past years, of their separation, seemed to fade into the distance and all that Matthew knew was the feeling of floating euphoria that he felt being with his love, reunited at last and as one again. Thomas’ legs wrapped around him as he spurred Matthew on and Matthew moaned, his lips coming to caress Thomas’ neck, before he met Thomas’ ear.  “I thought I’d never see you again, my beloved… My darling… My love!”  Thomas convulsed and Matthew cried out as Thomas’ orgasm brought his own. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*(FANART) Spy and Scout get off on torturing poor Sniper (not SpyScout if you were wondering) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Sniper is pinned between two thick walls that hold him firmly in place.  His wrists are bound and there's a bridle gag firmly in place.  The only openings in this claustrophobic prison are for his cock and his feet.  His bound wrists are tied to the wall behind him. The big toe on each foot is pulled back tight and secured to his padded ankle cuffs. That cock ring is attached to the outer wall, meaning Sniper can't pull his hips back AT ALL.  And Spy is a sadistic, cock-teasing motherfucker who has clearly been at work already.  Scout is just getting his jollies digging into those exposed soles and dragging his blunt nails over Sniper's heels and toes.  He likes the desperate wiggling the best, but the muffled screaming he hears is almost as good.  He might just drop his pants, lube up and fuck the space between Sniper's feet, but he wants to enjoy this by itself for a while. An added bonus to Sniper's torture is that Spy and Scout can't see or hear each other, so their attacks on him are random and uncoordinated, making it even more unbearable.   *~*TEXT*~*

Just what she needs after a long day of travel.     “I love you, Bloap,” says Yang. Four bubbles pop on Bloap’s surface in quick succession.   I love you too.       Yang begins to wash. Bloap’s suds is soft on her skin. It is, perhaps, the best feeling she has ever felt. Such a closeness she could never even have imagined before Bloap.     When she finishes washing, she raises Bloap to eye-level. “Now,” she says, “it’s my turn.”   Yoap is light in Blake’s hand, the fresh scent of citrus permeating the air. Blake begins to wash.     Bloap’s not protecting Yoap from germs, and Yoap’s not protecting Bloap.     They’re protecting each other. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Just a short little thing, I'm not sure if I'm gonna add any more but I'll post it here for now *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*It was one in the morning but Miss Venable was wide awake, all that could be heard were the loud squeaks that were coming from the bed as she rocked back and forth on it, she looked like a slut. A filthy, pathetic slut. She had her legs spread as wide apart as they could go while she worked her hand as fast and as hard as she could. The vulgar sounds of her own wetness slapping against the purple dildo as she shoved it in and out of her entrance only seemed to work the redhead up even more, not to mention how the toy stretched her every time it was fully in.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*A/N: I need more Oldseph/Wamuu fanfictions  The sounds in a bedroom was silence but sounds of wet noises.  "Mm, JoJo…"  "JUST CALL ME JOSEPH! Your dick is so big!"  "Oh. Okay Joseph."  Wamuu had notice Joseph's changes, he Joseph saying about he gets better with age similar to a fine wine, Wamuu had wondered if his other skills had improved.

*~*TEXT*~*While Shiro and Curtis kissed before cheering crowds, Keith stood way in the background with a lewd grin and a ring on his finger. Also a huge boner. After the wild party dwindled, Shiro and Curtis brought their third groom to the honeymoon suite.  "Fuck the law, I'm the goddamn captain of the Atlas, I can marry as many dudes as I want," Shiro said. "You two better fuck me until I'm sore."  "Wouldn't have it any other way,  captain, " Curtis said with a grin. Keith stripped naked and went Galra, complete with spiny cock and cute little fangs.  "Hope you like it ribbed for your pleasure, boys."  And they fucked wildly, all night long, with lots of fingering and blowjobs and ball-sucking and creampie and grinding and Keith's amazing spiny Galra dick. They took turns bottoming, but Shiro was on the bottom the most cause we all know he likes being spoiled. The sheets were soaked with cum and totally sticky by the time they were finished and they slept in the sticky mess because who the fuck can think about changing sheets after you're had the best fuck of your life? *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Reaper materializes behind his omega, running the back of a claw down his spine.              “I see you’ve been missing me,” he growls, making Hanzo tremble. Hanzo nods quickly, looking back at him.              “I have. Please.”  Reaper thumbs his finger over Hanzo’s hole, nodding approvingly when it comes back slick.              “Already presented for me and everything. How did you know I would be the one to come, and not someone else?”  Hanzo pants, whining.  “You always come on my heat.”              “I come off your heat too.” Reaper removes his gloves, pressing two fingers into him slowly. Hanzo shudders, reaching back to spread his cheeks for him.              “Fuck me, please.”              “Working on it, dragon.” Reaper pulls his cock out, stroking it to hardness as he watches slick drip from Hanzo’s hole. He presses in, pulling Hanzo back onto his cock. He fucks him fast. Hanzo comes twice in a row almost immediately, screaming into the pillow. Reaper fucks his knot in and out of him until it swells. He fucks in hard, knotting him. Hanzo sobs into the pillow, clenching around Reaper’s knot. Reaper strokes a hand down Hanzo’s back.              “Satisfied?”              “Mmm. For now.”              “We have your entire heat, love.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Orange liquid flowed through my fingers, letting it fall and stain the pristine white sheets. I held his soul within my small hands,I didn’t want to let him go. He holds me just as closely. He’s warm. I could hear his raspy voice gently whispering in my ear. I could not understand him, the only words I could comprehend was:  “I love you.”  I couldn’t tell if it was true or not at this point. I held his soul tighter. He quivers. Breath becoming heavier. The room was dark. The only thing that lit up the dark place was his orange soul. Illuminating both our faces. His face was orange too, but not from the glow. I placed my lips onto his soul. He shivers. I want to see it again, so I repeated my action. He grips the back of my clothes. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Mingyu's audio was still playing on Minghao's phone as he swallowed the pills, as if the older one's voice was the only thing that could save him. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*"Hey, baby. I'm sorry I couldn't make it in time. I miss you so much and I'm so sorry..."  Minghao closed his eyes, putting 5 pills on his tongue. One by one, they disappeared inside his throat.  "I had this awesome dream and you looked like a fucking angel. We were dancing inside this, umm- like a castle, something like that"  The dark-haired boy repeated his steps three more times, now holding a knife against his own neck. The pills just weren't enough, he needed to feel something. He sat on the ground, facing himself on the mirror.  "Anyway, I hope you're feeling better already and don't forget our lunch tomorrow. Can't wait to see you..."  He pressed the blade against the fragile skin, feeling his blood boiling while it dripped down his chest. Harder, harder. Minghao choked on his own blood, breathing sharply. The boy then closed his eyes, waiting for the end.  "I miss you so much... I wanna hug you so tight and kiss your whole face, I--"  "I l-love you, Ming- cof! Mingyu..."  "I love you lots baby. See you at 12. Bye!"  ---- *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He likes fucking her against the door.  He likes holding one of her wrists in an iron tight grip above her head while forcing the other to hold the doorknob to this room he’s forbidden her to ever go into. His cock fucks her roughly from behind, he pants like a rabid animal in her ear and sinks his teeth into the skin of her neck so hard she thinks he means to draw blood, and for the entire time her hands must remain in place or he’ll stop and make her put them back, his own hand such a crushing, white knuckled thing on top of her own on the doorknob that she doesn’t know if he’s trying to stop her from turning the knob or trying to make her do it instead.  Because sometimes it’s like he doesn’t just  expect  her to break her promise to not go into the room, it’s like he  wants  her to do it and every day she doesn’t is some kind of foreplay – her teasing him, drawing out his frenzy, until the moment of climax.  Until the moment she turns the knob, enters, and becomes yet another of Bluebeard’s forsaken, nameless wives. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Brian likes the sounds Rome makes. They're guttural moans, loud and echoing through the loft above the garage. Brian's planning on buying something to stick in Rome's mouth while they fuck. A scarf, a gag, a dildo perhaps...maybe just a banana. That might work. Thing is? Rome's just  loud . Brian likes the noises, but he's always jumpy. They're not so isolated, and people could conceivably just walk in. Especially when they screw during the day. Because sometimes, they can't keep their hands off each other. Rome will be leaning into an engine, and Brian will catch his eye... And it's off to the loft. Sometimes. Sometimes they don't even make it that far, and Brian will take Rome as he's sprawled on the steps, or Rome will grind him into the wall of the garage's office, blinds open, door swinging, Rome making those noises which drive Brian insane with lust. During the day, it's especially bad, because it's a bitch to have to wait downstairs while Rome showers quickly. Brian hates feeling sticky and itchy during working hours. But it's worth it to hear Rome groaning. *~*TEXT*~*
