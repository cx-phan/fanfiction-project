In Death, the child fairly blazed with power - never mind that he, shiftless student that he had been in life, had never done anything to deserve it.  The pitiless green of Harry's eyes looked back at him. 'And whose fault was that, Professor? You had a hand in it, too.'  Albus fought down a sob, as three more figures stepped out of the fog towards him.  'The only ones you ever feared.' Harry's voice! Like glass edged with gilt.   'But you know what they say about glass houses,' said Harry, and this time his voice was a hailstorm.  Albus covered his ears and very nearly wailed aloud.   'Even after all this time, you can't face your family?' whispered Harry, in the barest caress. Then with that touch of kindness, he turned and boarded the train, whose doors closed silently behind him.  Albus, at last, looked up to meet his fate.

Both are so passionate, so full of fire. It consumes the soul and leaves every synapse burning, flames devouring the mind like rain eats snow. Intoxicated, a body led by impulses, where conscious thought departs, leaving only instinct and sensory overload in its wake. Causing tremors, tears, laughter, sweat. A curious phenomenon.  Fiery red, too, is the mane obscuring the centre between alabaster thighs. A sighed name crafting the whole universe passes through an opened mouth, dripping off of parted lips to pool in the valley of an uncovered chest, vulnerable. Patience, beautiful light, is the given command. Mumbled against intimacy, vibrations reign. A shudder. Ready to soar, but with Icarus in the back of her conscience. She leaps.

The angel turned her page, and Yosafire fucked her harder, her tail coiling around her own leg as she grew close, her cock throbbing before she pumped Froze full of cum, sighing happily as she pulled out. The angel sighed, and gently pulled up her panties, sitting down with shaky legs. That had taken more out of her than she'd expected.
