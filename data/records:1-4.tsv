The day the music ended, was the day Rogue had put his hand through Sting's stomach, as dragons destroyed the world around them.  Sting had smiled at him, his half transformation into a dragon fading, and he'd thanked Rogue even as he'd bled out.  Thanked him for saving his soul.  As Sting died in his arms, so too did the music in Rogue's heart.  Replaced only by a soundless void, that ached for the bright melody it had once known.  And he resolved, in that moment, to do whatever was necessary to bring it back, to undo all that had befallen them.  Even if it meant sacrificing everything else.

The sixteen years of being together always felt like new, with every single day full of life, joy, and passion. And now the church bells rang joyfully, all of the guests were excited, and a new married life was about to begin.

He struggled to focus now on Yoichi, the man beside Mika who stared at him more intently. Without opening his mouth, his olive eyes sparkled out the words written in his chest. Yuu's eyes glazed with unshed tears... He forced a smile as a tear rolled down his cheek, but it was left unnoticed beneath his black wedding veil. He was getting married to Mika's friend, who loved him more than a best friend... A thing Mika could never do. 	Love Hurts	186	Teen And Up Audiences	"""Weddings are supposed to be happy. Yet...

Both are so passionate, so full of fire. It consumes the soul and leaves every synapse burning, flames devouring the mind like rain eats snow. Intoxicated, a body led by impulses, where conscious thought departs, leaving only instinct and sensory overload in its wake. Causing tremors, tears, laughter, sweat. A curious phenomenon.  Fiery red, too, is the mane obscuring the centre between alabaster thighs. A sighed name crafting the whole universe passes through an opened mouth, dripping off of parted lips to pool in the valley of an uncovered chest, vulnerable. Patience, beautiful light, is the given command. Mumbled against intimacy, vibrations reign. A shudder. Ready to soar, but with Icarus in the back of her conscience. She leaps. Lest the flames scar her while she flies.
