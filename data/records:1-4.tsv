(And he's constantly amazed how well Owen gets the raptors despite the fact they can't speak to each other). The point is, being a Dolittle means all animals sound like they're speaking English. But these are dinosaurs, so they sound like they're speaking old English.  Maybe the T-rex is speaking like Shakespeare or the Apatosaurus talk like something out of Pride &amp; Prejudice.

Leliana couldn't believe that she had done that, except for the part where she could, because this was Neria that she was talking about, and Neria had always been ready to sacrifice herself for others. It wasn't fair, for things to end like this. They had come so far already, they had fought for so long and accomplished so much. It wasn't fair that Neria didn't even get a chance to see this to the end, not properly anyway. It wasn't fair that Leliana was left all alone.

Even in her lowest points, when the weight of living was crushing, death was never something she seriously considered. She knew it would happen, eventually, but it seemed so far off. Death was hazy, death kept it's distance. Despite this, death was concept she liked to ruminate on in the darkest nights and the rainiest days. 'It's inevitable,' she'd say. 'Why shouldn't I think about it? There's no reason to be afraid of it.'  But this time was different. Her own kin was staring death in the face while it laughed at her from the shadows.

X and Zero wouldn't have to risk getting injured either.  Axl could use Red's auxiliary data to recreate his scythe. But Red's DNA data had turned him into what Red originally looked like. That meant there was one more detail to take care of.  A few cables had been exposed where Sigma had sent Axl crashing through the wall. He cut off a short length from one of these and placed it between his teeth. Then he planted the scythe handle on the floor, turned the point of its blade towards himself, and inclined it until it rested on his brow, angled just so over his right eye.  The blade's tip tickled – like a white-hot feather – where it pierced ever so slightly into his metal skin.

Only Libra's breaths beneath him, soft noises that edge from his throat. Lon'qu kisses his jaw, moves his calloused hand below the sheets.  Another, bordering on a gasp. Libra's neck twists, presses the side of his face into the splay of his hair, golden like cornsilk, like his well-loved rosary.  'Hush,' Lon'qu rasps, but doesn't stay his hand. Libra nods absent, the world distant, blurry through the warm waters of his mind. Still cries out at the feel of Lon'qu on his delicate skin.  Lon'qu's hands, hardened now from work rather than war. From the splitting of wood, careful tying of tomato plants to stakes. Hauling water from the well.  They fought two wars to come to this, fought death and gods and their own bodies, infested houses shot through with fear.
