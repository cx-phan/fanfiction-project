*~*SUMMARY*~*With Jane in her arms Sif can't feel too lost. (Written for Femslash February 2019. Sif/Jane, AU, complete.) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*It's easy to feel lost, now that Asgard is gone. She spends much time on Earth now, helping Thor's new band of warriors defeat their foes. But this, Sif thinks, is where she can feel at home even with Asgard naught but a memory. She rests her head on Jane's hair and breathes in the smell of Earth flowers. Incredible how much wonder and passion can fit into Jane's slight frame. The marvel of Midgardians. Here, she is content. With Jane by her side or Thor at her back inbattle she is the most herself. And not at all lost. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The king's golden touch does not please everyone. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“Such wonderful news from the war, my lady! The king has swept all before him.”   Miriel mustered a smile for the benefit of her attendant, a high born Númenorean woman who normally displayed considerably less sound good sense than the palace cat.   From the size of the force her husband had taken across the sea, she would have been very surprised if he’d returned with his tail between his legs.  For all his arrogance, he was a strong leader with a golden touch, and his men would follow him anywhere.  As would the women of the palace.  All except her. *~*TEXT*~*

Victor Fleming, 1939) Avengers Fairy Tales, No. 4 (Marvel, 2008)  Tickled by the challenge playlist for guest of honor  Kelly Sue DeConnick , I figured I could manage a one-shot vid for the  Emerald City  episode that she wrote. It seemed appropriate to choose another song from the same album, and "Look Into My Eyes" was the shortest! It was perfect for the theme of media authorship as adaptation and transformation. I wanted to incorporate some comics since that's DeConnick's primary oeuvre. Did I know that Marvel did an Avengers reimagining of  The Wizard of Oz ? I did not! I found that by looking on Wikipedia. *~*TEXT*~*

When I developed the concept, did I know that George Clinton put out a Metropolis-themed music video in 1996? I did not!

*~*SUMMARY*~*A drabble about the colour green and what it means to Kara. Established supercorp. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The colour green was a complex one. There’s Kryptonite, the one substance that could render Kara powerless, strip her of her strength, the one thing she prized so greatly. The green, whilst it looked bright, she associated with fearful, painful days spent in the DEO medbay, feeling empty- as if every fibre of her being had been drained from her. Heavy limbs, heavy head,  a fog so thick she couldn’t function, sinking lower and lower and lower… Only to be pulled out of this spiral by the same colour which plunged her down into it. Bright green eyes, like jade, but somehow more pure and wild. The same green eyes that she wakes up to every morning, the same green eyes that glint with mischief, the same green eyes that fill with tears when she receives the same call from Alex because ‘damn it Kara why do you have to be so selfless’, the same green eyes that comfort her, the same green eyes that she fell in love with the second she saw them. The eyes of Lena Luthor. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*There’s a light kiss pressed so softly on her forehead, if she’d not been awoken by the sound of Charlotte entering moments ago, Becky wouldn’t have felt it. She wouldn’t have heard Charlotte’s soft words, as she laid it all on the line to the beautifully unconscious Becky - because that was the only way Charlotte could get it out. She would have never known. . .  And as Charlotte drifts off, she’s now left to wonder how much of this had she missed. How many visits hadn’t woken her up. And what exactly Charlotte had said in her previous unheard midnight whispers. *~*TEXT*~*

Arthie rolls her eyes and then settles herself back down against Yoyo again.   "Wake me up when we get there", she mutters softly in Yolanda's shoulder.   The other woman smiles, places a quick peck on Arthie's forehead and whispers,  "Alright, baby". *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*You stared down at the adorable man on his knees before you. His dark eyes were doe-like, holding his love for you, his question, and a hint of determination.   You knew he wanted this more than anything, wanted you more than anything, and you weren’t giving him an answer right away because you just wanted to stay in this moment for a while. You wanted to etch the way he was gazing up at you into your mind, memorize the exact notes his voice had taken when he asked, “Will you be my wife?”  But when you noticed the lines of his face begin to fall and the resolve in his brown orbs falter, you realized you could not take your time any longer.   You joined him on the floor, your arms going to wrap around his neck as his palms found the small of your back, and pressed a kiss to his eyelid, “Yes, my love.”  His hold on you tightened, and he buried his head into the crook of your neck.   “Thank you.”  “No, Thomas,” you hummed against his cheek. “Thank you.”  He was the best birthday gift ever given to you. *~*TEXT*~*

She could not help gasping, or her eagerness in pulling that one apart to find Garibaldi, and then Franklin, and then Sheridan.  "Matryoshka dolls," Susan said, before opening Sheridan… to see herself, and knew one remained. Her fingers shook at revealing Talia.  "She is always within you," Delenn said softly. *~*TEXT*~*

This being a common name, generic anti/hero and name-of-all-trades. And there was, of course a big bad wolf.   Beginning There is: Winter, a forest, a basket, a path. Innocent and smiling girl heads to her doom. (Oncemorewithfeeling.) Events fall out of sequence.   Middle The basket falls and the ice on the path crack/splinters/changes/is changed/nothing (delete as applicable). This is an important lesson. About time. Dramatic licence prevails in a series of unlikely but significant events.   Begin Again Once upon a time there was. A time. Which was eaten. By a sheep dressed as a wolf.   End Happily, they all lived. (Never after.) In other versions, Red and the wolf eat Granny. Apocryphally, reality shifts back to normal. More or less. Less. Yes. Or. Choose your own adventure. *~*TEXT*~*

But if you want cookies for Valentines day, they’re going to be store bought.”  Kissing Cora, she responds, “Hey, don’t worry about Valentines day right now. Do you and Derek need a place to stay?” Remembering Peter, she wonders if there’s any possible way she can just- not offer her girlfriend’s uncle a place after his home caught on fire  again .  “We’re staying at Peter’s apartment.”  “Right, I forgot- what caused the fire?”  “Me trying to make you cookies.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*It's not the wedding she remembers. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Even years later, despite endless photos proving otherwise, most of the wedding guests remembered Amatu's eyes glowing red as it flickered into sight. Cagalli didn't remember that - she remembered Amatu rising, yes, but that wasn't the first thing she thought of when she thought back. Instead she thought of being dumped into Amatu's cockpit and the red lips of her unexpected savior as he told her to hang on. She hadn't had any idea at the time why Rondo Ghina Sahaku was rescuing her - instead she just grabbed at his flightsuit and restraints, trying to find something to keep her in place as Amatu maneuvered around to get them clear. And she remembered still hanging on after they retreated to the Izumo and descended to the hangar deck, her too-thick wedding-day-makeup smeared on the sleeve of Ghina's flightsuit. Her exact words were lost to her, but she remembered apologizing and reaching to wipe away a coral-tinted smudge. He told her not to let it happen again and Cagalli looked down at her grease-streaked wedding dress and shook her head slowly before gathering the strength to meet Ghina's gaze. It wouldn't, she promised. It wouldn't. *~*TEXT*~*

Hermione jumped, then turned to him, resolutely. "Severus, tell me honestly," she stuck her chin out at him.  "Am I growing a moustache?" He sat down, exasperatedly.  "What is it with witches of a  Certain Age ?  As if it wasn't bad enough having Pomona asking for something to improve the whiskers on her wart, or Irma--" He checked himself at her wide-eyed look.  "So you're not  trying  to grow one, then?" *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*So as you know, if you don't publish at least one chapter before a month they'll automatically delete it and you  can't  get it back. I has a story with  at least  twelve chapters that I hadn't published yet. It's been a month but some of my sister's works were still there after more than a month so I thought  "This is just to get people to publish their stuff and not have a crowded draft menu."  I was wrong. They  do  delete things. So, my fairly long story that I wasn't ready to publish anything of went  poof . I worked  really  hard on that! The people who run this site really thought having a system that  deletes  your  hard work  was a good idea.   Stop.   If I don't want to publish my work yet, I shouldn't be forced to publish it.  I'm not leaving Archive because I have good stories that I was forced to publish on here and I'm not transferring four chapters that are probably the equivalent of several pages to Quotev, the other site I write on.  If there's way to recover deleted stories, tell me.   Please .   *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Elphaba can't stop thinking about Glinda *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Elphaba would always associate pink with Glinda. Mainly because that'd been the color of Glinda's dress when their friendship began. The other girl wore other colors, of course: white, yellow, blue, even green. Yet, when Elphaba thought of Glinda, imagined her during those long, lonely nights on the run from the Wizard and his cronies, she pictured Glinda in that pink dress. They'd been so young and so naïve. Sometimes, Elphaba wished she could go back to that time, maybe do things differently. Wishes were pointless, though. She couldn't change things with wishing. Change would only come if she  did  something instead. So that's why she began to make plans to see Glinda again. Maybe this time she'd have the courage to admit to her feelings for Glinda. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Today was a day in bed. It had been a long week and on a Saturday afternoon, all I wanted to do was enjoy the company of my doting and adorable boyfriend. Currently, he’s snuggled up to me and The Office is playing faintly in the background. My eyelids feel heavy and the pleasant sensation of fingertips trailing curiously on my stomach seems to be the only thing keeping me from falling asleep.  It’s quiet, warm, and everything I could hope for after a stressful week of work.  Apollo is deep in thought, looking up at me with adoring, half-lidded eyes. “Will you marry me?”, he whispers. I’m sure he didn’t mean for me to hear him but I smile anyway. “Of course”, I say to him. His eyes close and he smiles, a blush rising on his cute face. He nuzzles against my stomach and falls asleep. I follow his lead. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*You can barely recall their faces,  your parents—  only the clouded haze of childhood, faded.  Yet you are reminded of them daily.  It’s a waypoint,  Hammerhead is,  hub for the passersby, travelers…refugees.  In the weary eyes of the woman clutching her children close,  you see your mother,  telling you to run, to hide.  The echo of your father’s arms  lingers in the thankful embrace of the old man whose truck you repaired—  the man who risks his life every day to shuttle food to Insomnia.  You’ve seen a lot,  working this job.  But this might be the oddest yet:  four boys—and they  are  boys, little more than children—with a burden they do not know how to carry,  broken-down car too fine for the road ahead,  and no idea how the world works outside their shining city.  Amidst the amusement and the exasperation—  gil isn’t  that  complicated—  you have to bite back the words that want to slip through your lips:  “Oh, boys.  Y’all ain’t seen nothin’ yet.” *~*TEXT*~*

Feathers - by definition are light, but those one’s are heavy; for Charlotte at least, they mean more than decoration. They signify her family. It’s a weight she feels on her shoulders every time she wears one, no matter the colour.  And if Becky truly believes she can all carry that, then good luck to her.  In the MMC as herself, Becky would dominate. But wearing a robe, no.  Charlotte may wear a crown, but there be thorns - and it hurts. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Rose's new hoodie is off limits. Well, where the Doctor's concerned, she supposes she'll make an exception. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Rose had just slipped her newly purchased TARDIS blue hoodie on and was headed down to the kitchen to enjoy her morning cuppa. Suddenly she felt a warm body press up behind her and arms encircle her from behind.   If she hadn’t already known who it was, the suddenness of the embrace would have sent the ex-dimension hopping Torchwood operative into fight mode. Instead, she leaned into the embrace and placed her hands over the ones lying flat against her stomach.   Still, Rose was rather eager to head downstairs and get her morning dose of caffeine. “Excuse me, Doctor, but this‘s a brand new hoodie and you can’t touch it. At least, not until after I’ve had my morning cuppa.”  “Oh, is it now, Rose Tyler? Too late, I’m already rather attached to it,” the words, whispered right next to her ear, sent a pleasant shiver down her spine, as did the arms tightening around her possessively. “Besides, who needs a morning cuppa when you’ve got me,” the Doctor said arrogantly, making her turn in his arms with a chuckle.   Several kisses later, Rose decided that her Doctor was indeed all the caffeine she would ever need. *~*TEXT*~*

He’s a dork, and you’re going to be a dork’s wife.  “Maybe so?” you answered, trying to keep a serious face, and you saw the color drain out of Barry’s.  There he was, down on one knee, his blue eyes wide and hopeful until you gave him that ambiguous answer. Now, his expression was faltering, his light brows knitting in confusion. You almost felt bad— almost .  “What does that mean?” he asked, getting to his feet.   “It means, Mr. Allen,” you placed a hand on his cheek, stroking his skin with your thumb, “that I’ll be accepting your name.”  Barry brightened visibly, his grin stretching for miles as he leaned down and pressed a chaste kiss to your cheek, “So yes?”  “Yes,” you nodded, reaching up to peck the area above his nose. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It was an increasingly familiar sight- Rosa and Kain curled around each other and fast asleep by the time Cecil finally made his way back to their chambers. He couldn't help but smile. They hadn't waited up, however, though he always suspected that they tried, at least for a bit.  Quickly, he stripped down to the last of his layers and quietly tried to crawl under the covers beside them. Kain opened his eyes first, though Rosa was the one to reach for him. Then they both pulled him closer, tugging him between their bodies to sleep, warm, and together. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Battle was often hard on Stephen. It was always harder on Tony. Stephen only dealt with mystical threats and magic, while Tony dealt with Hydra and aliens. This often left Tony with many injuries after a mission. And Stephen took it upon himself to heal him.   It always started with a hot bubble bath. Stephen would massage Tony to the best of his ability, and let him sit there until he looked like a prune. Then, he would comb through his hair with his fingers, gently removing all the tangles while Tony air dried.   Then came the dressing. Stephen would expertly wrap all of Tony's wounds, applying a special healing cream before he dressed them. Then, he would dress Tony in the softest flannel pants and tuck him into bed. He would lay there next to Tony for hours until he fell asleep, making sure Tony felt safe and secure.   And only when Tony finally fell asleep, did Stephen give him a good night kiss and roll over to sleep. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*your guess is as good as mine buddy *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Maribelle doesn’t wake up late too often, so when Lissa seizes the day with a head start she swears to make Maribelle’s awakening as chaotic as she can make it with however much time she has. A little bit of gel on the floor, sugar swapped out for salt, a frog in the dresser and a cut open pillow ready to throw and have feathers cover  everywhere .  The final touch is a glass of water for a chilly start, to be drizzled over Maribelle's face. Maribelle’s pretty,  pretty  face and her curls and her  lips  and-  “Hmm.” And Lissa’s not sure she should disturb her, so as gently as she can she kisses her cheek, grinning like Gangrel after he ruined someone’s day again.  She pours the water on Maribelle anyway. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Kadaj looked at Zack, who slowly shook his head. Yazoo and Loz wouldn't be any help, Kadaj knew. They were going to have the same problem once they got to this step.  He searched his memories and the memories that weren't really quite his, but all he could think was 'up down up down--' and that seemed to be for something else. Honestly, someone had to-- Aerith swept into the room, beaming broadly once she saw him.  Kadaj winced and started to gesture...  "Tie it yourself or I'll send you back naked." And he was pretty sure she meant it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Ryoma was never surprised to find Corrin like this, asleep on a thin blanket on the floor, bathed in warm sunlight and with the tiniest of smiles on her face.  The more he heard of her life in Nohr, the less he thought it was truly some horrible thing. She'd been loved, no doubt, and she'd been cared for and taught well.  Yet there had been something, at first, unpolished and dim and lacking. Ryoma didn't know the word for it, but he saw it. And he watched, with love, as Corrin broke through it.  Here in Hoshido, she shone. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Sebastian knew he had some self-destructive habits. Joseph had seemingly made it his life's mission to make sure Sebastian knew how destructive those habits were. Not going an hour without thinking about taking a cigarette break wasn't exactly healthy. He picked up another box of matches and ignored the carton next to them. The longer he went without lighting up, the more frequent the little gifts of matches-and-cigarettes became. He wished Joseph was around to nag him. Or was around at all. It would make it so much easier to hold off, nagging or no. He really needed a smoke. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The giggling was the first warning.  The second was a yelp and something that sounded suspiciously feline.  Hera took a deep breath. Was this really going to be a repeat of the old days, as she helped Sabine and Ahsoka in their quest?  Jacen's laughter got louder, and Hera just called back to the lounge. "If you two have smuggled something aboard, I will turn this ship around to go back!"  Ahsoka came forward, grinning. "Hera, it's a harmless lothcat, and it followed Chopper aboard."  Hera sighed, covering her face. "Harmless. Lothcat. Seriously?"  "Jacen likes her."  Hera accepted her fate. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*What was that noise? It was the tiniest of sounds. Somehow cutting through the sound of traffic filtering into the town car, catching Andrea’s ear and causing her to tilt her head towards Miranda. The corners of her mouth curved at the sight of her beloved embodiment of sophisticated perfection who was currently staring intently at her phone. Andrea scooted towards Miranda, leaning into her as she glanced at Roy who smiled back but showed no sign of sharing her curiosity.  Seriously, what was that noise? Did she just hear it again? Was Miranda...blushing? “Darling, I adore your sense of culinary adventure but we will NEVER have chilaquiles for brunch again.”  “Yes, Miranda.” “...and for goodness sake, crack a window.” *~*TEXT*~*

Ed chuckled at the assumption. “There’s nothing going on.” It was Joe’s turn to chuckle, using air quotes to try and turn the  “Anything for you?”  comment he just heard into a confession. Biting back a sigh, Ed started, “Alex and I have gotten to know each other, and we sometimes share a takeout when we’re doing trial prep.” pausing briefly he added. “It’s not a secret that we’ve become friends.” *~*TEXT*~*

Dan was breathtakingly beautiful in this moment, the pale moonlight reflecting off his face and creating a silver blush that was unique to anything Phil had ever seen before. Dan’s eyes mirrored the sky above him, dark and mysterious and, at the same time, so blindingly full of light. Looking closer, Phil could even see the faint freckles that dotted the other boy’s face, dusting his pale cheeks in a smattering of constellations that seemed to have spilled straight from the sky itself and onto the skin of the boy who ached to explore it. Dan exhaled quietly, looking more vulnerable and exposed than he ever had before, and it was in that moment Phil knew: he was a goner. He could stay next to Dan forever, the lovely boy who gazed at the stars--and the stars, who gazed back. *~*TEXT*~*

It’s so different from that first morning after, waking up to my arm stretched out over empty space and no trace of Niki to be found except for her smell on my pillow and her number scrawled out on a candy wrapper by the bed. Waking up with her is something I once only fantasized about, but the reality is better – her body warmer, the scent of her not a faint afterthought but fresh under my nose. If I can start every morning like this, I will – forever. *~*TEXT*~*

Mary Poppins didn't have a name on her wrist.  Bert didn't mind. She could never be his, but he he loved her and he knew that, in her own way, she loved him too. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He hummed a lively hymn as he pried off the lid of the large, heavy crate with his bare hands. Something jolly and upbeat about Ragnaros consuming His foes in vengeful flames that went on to scour the whole world. It took the edge off the extreme irritation he felt at having to spend money to have his own head mailed back to him at great expense. Postage fees from Orgrimmar to a place they considered 'out here in the badlands' were exorbitant. It wasn't HIS fault his Golem guards had a distinct distaste for returning the Goblin couriers alive and with all their limbs intact. Lowering the visor of his safety goggles - he didn't want to damage another perfectly good face - he selected a replacement body at random, filled the neck with Thorium solder, then summoned raw primal flame on the palm of his hand. His fingers moved as precisely as if he was his own conductor, welding the Golem's head smoothly to the body. A quick incantation made the runes of activation glow and brought the thing to life.  Expensive as it was, a change was good for a self made man like Golem Lord Argelmach. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Sai's thoughts on nighttime in modern day Tokyo. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Sai hated the noise the most.   From the unending hum of the electrical wires to the honking of cars, the perpetual cacophony of sound overwhelmed him. The era when he had been born was peaceful . . . quiet . . . where one could hear the crimson maple leaf land in a still pond. The loudest sound encountered was either the pounding of carpenters or the crack of a tree felled by an axe. Nothing compared to the jackhammers or airplanes of today.   At one time, he had thought that Torajiro's era was too loud with their rifles and rickshaws. Now, he knew he owed his previous host a very heartfelt apology.   During the day, with Go to distract him, he was able to ignore most of the din. But at night, with nothing to entertain him and no need to sleep, he found the constant noise intolerable.   He didn't have much of a choice though, the alternative was oblivion or imprisonment. Neither of which he wanted to contemplate.   So he settled in, trying to read the newspapers Hikaru had left strewn about for him. All the while the bustling sounds of modern day Tokyo filtered into the room. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*They were opposite in every way. Pure light and pure darkness. Black against rainbow. The witch and the angel. And not only in their powers. Prep and goth. Troubled and popular. They were so different, the way they acted, they way they saw the world, they way they dressed. But maybe there was some truth to what was said, about how opposites attract. Because when they kissed, it was the meeting of two worlds. Because when they kissed, all their differences didn't matter, all the differences between them went away. Because when they kissed, all was right in the world. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*It's been 7 years. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“7 years.”  The room was quiet as Himchan uttered those words, each member wearing a different expression. A few days ago marked their seventh anniversary. They shared success and pain, fell to the ground, stood back up hand in hand, and now--  “I wish it could’ve been longer,” Himchan said in a shaky voice.  “Who says it can’t be?” Daehyun said sharply.  He reached his hand out in the center.  “I have no regrets.” Youngjae added.  “Me neither.” said Zelo.  “Even alone, we’re still B.A.P.” Yongguk said. “Remember that.”  All their hands were over the other. Himchan slowly smiled and nodded, joining in. “We’re not going to be separated very long either, huh?”  Jongup nodded. “I think we can’t escape each other.”  Everyone started laughing, but it was true; they were like brothers, a family.  Putting their hands up, they shouted; “We’re the B.A.P, Yes Sir!” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Yongguk wasn't supposed to be here today. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Everyone was surprised to see Yongguk at the table that morning.  “I thought you were busy at the studio this week.” said Junhong.  All he did was grin widely, not saying anything.  “Hey hyung, did you take more bread again?” Daehyun asked.  He shook his head.  “Did you sleep well?” Jongup inquired.  He simply nodded, his gum smile not fading.  Himchan suddenly emerged from the hallway and called, “Oh, Yongnam! When did you get here?”  Everyone’s eyes widened in confusion whilst Yongnam started laughing.   “How can you tell?” Youngjae asked, amazed.  Himchan poured some coffee. “It’s easy. He’s not Yongguk.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Jongup was outside, just staring at Daehyun’s now totaled car he had borrowed, crashed into a wall. As Junhong rode down the sidewalk on his skateboard, he nearly fell off at the sight.  Jumping off his skateboard, he picked it up and ran over to Jongup’s side. “Did you seriously just…?”  “Yup.”  “You just….!”  “Uh-huh.”  “Hyung’s gonna….!”  “Probably.”  Junhong was both impressed and a little concerned how calm Jongup was. “Aren’t you scared?”  He shook his head. “No.”  “Why? You totaled his brand new car!”  Jongup turned his head. “At least it wasn’t Himchan’s car.”  Junhong couldn’t argue with that. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Why's the toast taking so long? *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Daehyun was searching the cabinets for bread to make some toast. Yongguk took a lot of it to feed the ducks this morning. Oh well, they would’ve gone to waste otherwise.  After finding a loaf, Daehyun set it on the table and waited for his toast to pop. Several minutes past and he was getting nervous. But there was no burning smell. This was odd.  “Youngjae! Has my toast popped up yet?”  “What toast?” he replied, holding up the loaf bag. “You didn’t even put it in!”  Daehyun staggered back, confused. “But I swear I--”  Youngjae hummed the X-Files theme. *~*TEXT*~*

I’m always the last one to know everything!" he threw up his hands.   Remus rolled his eyes. "No you're not. We tell you stuff."  "Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when James got burned by that fire crab in class."  James winced at the memory. That was rough.  "And I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Sirius first year."  Remus' eye twitched. He tried to gestured for him to shut up.   Sirius made a surprised noise.   "...looks like I was the second-to-last to know." Pete said smugly.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"Here you go!" Eddie said with an audible grin. Arthur picked up the metal tube hesitantly. It was shaped to be grippable by a hand, well, a hand the size of his hands. There was a switch. There was no cutting bit anywhere. He peered in one end--blackness--and at the other--a solid chunk of metal. "Point it away from you!" Eddie said. Arthur held it out and slid the switch. It buzzed and hummed and a huge laser shot out the end and he shrieked and dropped it. It turned off. "That'll open your tin!" Eddie said. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Anything worth doing is worth doing exquisitely, whether it is entirely in keeping with who one ought to be or not: sugar roses, pastel meringues, kisses. The latter are the hardest to perfect, as one cannot practice them alone, and without the right partner desire melts like spun sugar in humidity. One grows used to tradition, to the way things are done, the comfortable, whether or not it is passé. And then there is another partner who might be right, who wants to break all the traditions and exceed them. That, too, can be exquisite, in new and shining ways. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Inspired by DECLARE and Sir Henry Newbolt's poem "Vitai Lampada" (the one that starts "There's a breathless hush in the Close tonight ...") I've always loved the threads of poetry running through Tim Powers' work, and this is a very small homage to that. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*There's a breathless weight on the Île tonight, And a dizzying song on the buzzing wire; The stars wheel drunk in the moonless height, And the days are short and the dreams afire; And it's not for the sake of an ailing King, Or a sceptred isle or a world made free, But the vows that decade to decade ring - Return, return, and so will we. The sand of the desert is mirror black, Black as the bones of the next who dies; The stars rock round in the ancient track, A burning wheel with a thousand eyes; The ice is cracked on the chasm of years, And England's far, and honour a lie; But the deed is done and the endgame nears, And over the mountain the voices die. This is the horror that exiled rules While under Moskva the stones are set; Close as a shadow with teeth for jewels, For the blood of the covenant is constant yet - But the traitor's taken his dying breath, And the hungry grave lays the shrapnel bare; And it all folds up in the shape of death, Returning to dust and ash and air. *~*TEXT*~*

He can’t shake that memory, the image of Manus on the floor with his eyes closed, blood dripping from his nose, body shaking violently with convulsions.    He has to remind himself daily that he’s okay. Magnus is okay and healthy, he has his magic back and is no longer suffering from the side effects of magic loss, they’re happy and settled, everything is finally tranquil after a year of heartbreak and loss.   But Alec…   Alec can’t bring himself to enter his office at The Institute. The memory is too fresh, too painful, of Magnus, lying on his floor, dying and Alec was helpless, he only could stare and call for help but everything else was out of his control.   He doesn’t like that feeling. Powerless.    He doesn’t want to feel like that ever again.    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*An update as to why I havent posted. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*So I havent been updating my stories at all for a while and it is because of a few things, one thing is school. A typical answer but try doing this and also doing a senior project at the same time. Second is the lack of motivation as I'm seeing this as a chore rather than fun sometimes and I'd like to not have it be that way. Lastly is the time when I write it's at 12 am to 2 am. Usually I don't have the psychical energy to do it as I'm tired. So yeah that's the reasons. *~*TEXT*~*

The three Rodian bruisers were quick to aim and fire, but not quick enough. The Trandoshan boss brought his own blaster up, but again, the Togruta moved faster than he anticipated. Her forehead met his snout, the hard central stone of her headdress making him see stars.  In the dance of chaos that followed, all four wound up on the floor, unconscious for the Empire to find.  Ahsoka Tano walked free, satisfied by it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Alice Kirkland was late for work. Again. She wanted to just get up and leave but her girlfriend had other ideas.   Wait, that sounded really suggestive. Not like that.   You see, Amelia was a witch. Not like something dumb and magical, but she actually practiced it--crystals, potions, rituals, stuff like that. And don't worry, Alice trusted her not to do anything that bad. At least on purpose or something.   But in a way though something bad happened though. She was the reason why Alice was late to work.   "Just hold on," Amelia was saying brightly, eyes twinkling slightly. "I'm gonna dress you, okay? Using magic! It'll work this time too, I promise!"  Alice sighed. She'd been here for ages. Currently she was wearing a ball room dress, which she couldn't go to work in now, could she? She'd been dressed as a knight and a clown before.   "It'll work..."  Alice wanted to say no. She really did. But--  Amelia was so happy.   So all she did was smile.   "Okay," she said finally. "One more time." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*A conversation in the brig. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The brig was silent.   Apollo rapped his knuckles on the metal bars before taking a breath to speak.  "I just wish you would have done something."   "Lee..."   A ring in the air as Apollo hit the bars of his cell. "Dammit, Laura!"   The guard on duty shifted, forcing Apollo's voice down lest the entirety of Galactica have another rumor for the gossip mill.   "Dammit, Laura, it was  one  thing. We just needed that one thing."  "People would have died, Lee. I can't accept that."  "Because what's happening is better."   She didn't give a response.   The brig was silent once more. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*You're not sure if this is what being shattered feels like. You don't know if you want to be sure. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Pure. Unmitigated. Pain. You've taken so many other aches in stride. Lapis almost drowning you. Jasper headbutting you unconscious. Amethyst slamming you into the Sky Arena. Having a mother you'll never meet. They all pale in comparison to the burning warmth coursing through your cells at present. Every cubic centimeter of you feels as if it's on fire, but despite that, you still feel your entire body shudder like you're stuck in a cold snap. Your brain, as if on overdrive, moves a mile a minute, yet everything around you seems to be moving so slowly. You wonder if, despite your gem's removal, you've somehow gained the new power of super speed. You think you're going to throw up, but some fragment of the back of your mind that for some reason still cares about decorum says that puking while you're trapped in the grasp of a giant space dictator is a  huge  diplomatic faux pas, so you try your best to keep it down. Everything sounds far away. Your ears are ringing, so nothing sounds too awful clear. Things are starting to look far away, too, passing in and out of focus as your vision dims. You pass out. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The sterekdrabbles challenge for 01/30/19: “cupboard, fall, slam” I write a lot of variations on their first meeting... *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*A weathered cupboard stacked with tools, clay pots, leaned off-kilter beside the witch’s door. Derek knocked. Silence. Knocking more firmly, “Madam Maybelle?” he called. An alarming sequence of crashes, slams, and what sounded like someone falling every other step, followed. “Madam Maybelle’s not in! Apprentice Mieczysław Stilinski!” A breathless young man, no older than Derek, opened the door. “At your service!” “D-Derek Hale?” “Pick-up for the Hale sisters! Yes! The menses tea!” The boy flailed away, returned, packet in hand. Derek paid, turned back toward the road. “Come again!” he heard. Derek doubted he’d mind repeating this chore next month. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~* Webbed   They found her next to a stream; she didn’t remember a thing. Too young, they said, if they didn’t deem her half-witted. Too young, too unwanted, too alone. Too injured, too traumatized.  She looked human. Only her eyes still held the otherworldly light that let the rare (so,  so  rare) children like herself see in the Deep, and it, too, diminished, vanished the longer she lived in the sun and the more people focused on her hands.  Even as a child Eliza bathed whenever she could. (Eliza, they called her, after someone’s sister long dead.) As if the tub of water could take her back to what had come before. Never afraid she would down.     . *~*TEXT*~*

"They will be back." Crowley sighed then turned away to snuggle deeper into his sleeping bag. Aziraphale wouldn't learn this part. Ever. They might discuss this issue for the next few millenia if Crowley allowed it. But, as habits went, Crowley liked sleep so sleep it would be right now. The rest could wait. If necessary, forever. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*George Crawley was in love. He didn’t care that the one he loved was older, that they were working class, or even that they were a man; all he cared about was that he had never felt this way before. George had known he was attracted to men since he had started at Eton, the older he’d become, the more certain he felt. He had touched the other boys and they had touched him and it felt nice, but they weren’t the ones who he dreamed of every night.   None of them made him feel the way that Barrow did. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*She was what she had made herself. Invaluable.  There were more aquamarines before, in the war. They had been excellent spies, but of course, spying is a dangerous job, so many disappeared.  Others, later on, trusted her when they really shouldn’t of.  What with this time of shortages, there was little efficiency in creating an aquamarine, being so highly resource consuming during creation, and with the high rate of failure.  Which was all the better for her, being the only one who can do her job gives the freedom to… well, do her job. In the most interesting way possible. *~*TEXT*~*

He dreams of his mother's voice singing him to sleep. He dreams of his father, so stern and unforgiving.  He dreams of the approval he so desperately wanted but was so rarely given.  He dreams of the opportunities lost, never to be regained. He dreams of his brother.  His beloved brother.  The brother he thought was so evil.  The brother who sacrificed so much to save him.  The brother he lost before he could forgive him.  At night, Sasuke dreams.  At night, Sasuke weeps.  -- *~*TEXT*~*

Are you just saying that ‘cause you think its what  I  wanna hear?” “Are you saying you don’t?” Newt grinned in relief. “What I want is to indulge in that other fanfic staple – two guys in love cuddling for an unnecessary 20 minutes.”  “We have a meeting,” Hermann objected before shuffling back. “Better make it 15.” *~*TEXT*~*

Like when someone wants to accomplish something impossible, but one person humors it. In ways, Lady enables him, I don't recall her ever scolding him, but instead coaxing him on if he wants her, he has to make sacrifices he doesn't want to. *~*SUMMARY*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Derek wishes Stiles would just believe him when he says things instead of making Derek show him. He told Stiles that he can find him wherever he’s hiding, because Derek’s a werewolf.  They’re playing hide-n-seek  again  because Stiles doesn’t believe him (not in the mean way doesn’t believe him, though.)  Stiles giggles every time he’s hiding and Derek finds him that way. But Stiles wants Derek to find him when he doesn’t giggle and Derek doesn’t think that can happen, ever.  Stiles’s scent is everywhere now. It’s making Derek feel funny in his tummy.  Then he hears Stiles giggle  again . *~*TEXT*~*

Watanuki turned to see Doumeki. Watanuki reused to his side as he started to cry.  “What is wrong?” Doumeki asked. “Are you hurt?”   “No, you big idiot,” Watanuki said in a gasp as tears streamed down his cheeks.  “Then why are you crying then?” Doumeki asked wiping away some of the tears.  “Yuuko came back,” Watanuki whispered leaning heavily against the other Doumeki’s eyes are wide for a second before wrapping his arms around Watanuki in a hug.  “Don’t worry I will be there for you,” Doumeki said.  “No that is not it. I finally get to be here with you,” Watanuki said before leaning up to press a kiss against Doumeki’s cheek. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Seeing my series evolve from one story that I had started, stopped, continued again, and finally finished has been one of the greatest feelings of my life. I know it may sound corny, but it's nice to have it finished and posted on the internet as an accomplishment. Since I have gotten two prompts before, and I have just started posting the first few chapters of Promnesia, I figure now is a good time to create a work to simply have a place to have my prompts requested. I will take into consideration any and all prompts, and one person can request multiple things. When I fulfill my prompts, I do post them as a gift to those who requested (if they are a registered user). *~*TEXT*~*

He does. Ike just wishes it was anyone else. Wishes you at least weren’t so friendly with the man. He see’s the two of you interacting and wishes, just a little, that you had taken his warning seriously, and decided to stay as far away as possible from the Black Knight when you weren’t on the battlefield.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Bucky's foot jiggles up and down impatiently. It's cold outside, cold stinging his nose, but he can't help but wait. Steve - the song he sang that night - something about it stuck with Bucky.   For the last couple of months he had felt something shift between them. Almost a will they, won't they - but Bucky was almost completely sure he was wrong. Sure, Steve was petite, been made fun for it all the time as they were kids, and as such had been called - well. But he wasn't like that.  "It's gonna make it that much better, when we can say goodnight and stay together."  Bucky shuts his eyes, partially out of the cold.  "We could be married, and then we'd be happy, oh wouldn't it be nice?"  He loved him, oh God he loved him, even if he had to keep it a secret to stay safe. To keep Steve safe.   "Buck?" Bucky startles, Steve suddenly standing in front of him.  "Steve?" Bucky chokes out. His voice sounds rawer than he expected. "Hell of a performance."  "Yeah," Steve says, looking down, then up again. "What did you think?"  "It was perfect," Bucky replies, pulling Steve into a kiss. *~*TEXT*~*

Let’s inquire inside,” Peggy replied, tugging Angie down the stairs of the Gaslight, following the crowd.  “There’s a cover charge, ladies,” the tough looking woman at the door said. “You’re just in time. The next big comedian is just getting ready to go on.”  “I’ve no interest in listening to any more men complaining today,” Peggy said tartly, turning to go.  “It’s not a man. It’s Mrs. Maisel,” the woman replied.  Angie grinned, “I’ve heard of her! Let’s stay.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*A quiet evening with expectant parents *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Stiles sighs, burrowing as close to Derek’s side as he can with a freaking watermelon as a stomach. Almost as if he can hear Stiles’ unflattering thoughts, Derek makes a rumbling noise as he rubs a hand across Stiles’ skin. “I’m so  big !” “You’re perfect.” “I’m not going to be able to walk soon.” “I’ll carry you.” “I’m going to want to eat weird things  all the time ! Like   kale  !” Derek laughs, pressing a kiss against Stiles’ forehead, before softly muttering, “I love you.” Yeah, that? That makes every last bit of uncomfortableness worth it. “Love you too, big guy.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Even before you pushed, you knew he’d never forgive you. No one will believe it, but you actually did care about him. But you can’t let your feelings get in the way of the mission. That isn’t just true when you’re lying there handcuffed to the bed, or when they send you to entrap a man three times your age.  It isn’t just true when the helicarriers are falling from the sky, when you have to burn your colleagues and friends in order to root out HYDRA.  It’s always true. You have to be willing to sacrifice what you love. *~*TEXT*~*

You’re time as a savior will come.” Zelda believed in Urbosa’s words.  She still wished it wasn’t the last words Urbosa spoke to her. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The first time Jon heard his wife singing, he felt like he was being transported to another world. A wonderful and peaceful world. A world there would be only Jon, Daenerys and their children. A world, where the weight of their crowns did not hover like a yoke on their heads.                 After almost ten years of marriage, the beauty of her singing had not changed. It was a rare pleasure, Jon was sure, only he and their children could have the pleasure of hearing it.                 The queen was currently on the terrace overlooking the godwoods, singing slowly as she rocked the youngest of their children. The twillight sun gave the scene a fairy ambience. It was with regret that Jon stepped towards his wife. To his delight his wife did not stop even. Even when Jon gently put his arm around his waist, his beautiful song did not stop.                 Daenerys just raised his amethyst eyes to Jon. Joy and love shone in them like two merry priceless, Jon felt his heart swell with love while timidly he joined the song. His gaze turned to their daughters who watched them with love and joy. It was perfect. *~*TEXT*~*

And that was how they were, one sitting on the couch, the other resting her head on her lap, lazy fingers playing with her hair, watching series, oblivious to the whole world. That, was truly enough for them to feel good, to feel great, to be happy. *~*TEXT*~*

You might discover more in time.” “But I don’t  want  them!” Stiles backed up slowly.  “I don’t want them.”  He kept repeating the words over and over, breathing heavily and sinking to the floor with his hands covering his head. A gentle voice slowly coaxed him into a more normal breathing pattern.  “It’ll be okay,” Derek whispered. *~*TEXT*~*

I dreamt you found the light, and you kept her safe for the both of us. I can't blame you because I love her too.   I dreamt I'd always love you, and maybe that's okay. Maybe we can share you. She can have you in the day if I can see you in my sleep.  I dreamt you were a flower, and I was wrong. You were a soldier with a heart of his own. You had been all along. *~*TEXT*~*

Derek was standing over the stove, making his famous hot chocolate. Because this was real magic. Being married to Derek was everything Stiles had wanted for years. “I’m home,” Stiles murmured, grinning.  Derek looked up from his stirring, and the smile he gave Stiles was pure love. It was so damn good to be home. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The air whipped through the trees around Derek before suddenly stilling. The night remained quiet, eerily so. Then, a small breeze brought with it a scent both familiar and yet… not, followed by one he definitely didn’t recognize.  A growl rumbled in his chest when two figures stepped out from the trees and approached. One wore a red hoodie and the other. Well, if Derek didn’t know any better he’d swear he was looking at an older version of himself.  The two men grabbed hands and held tight, then looked at Derek.  “Come on, we have a fire to stop.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Derek ran his fingers down the soft cotton pooled around Stiles’ legs as Stiles sighed into Derek’s mouth.  “Red is a really good color on you,” Derek said. Stiles smiled at him, then patted his cheek.  “Of course you’d like me in red. Such a wolf,” Stiles said. Derek rolled his eyes, then gave Stiles another quick kiss before tapping Stiles’ legs. Stiles groaned but climbed off Derek’s lap. He straightened his skirt, then beamed as Derek held out his hand.  “Come on, we have a date to get to,” Stiles said as he hauled Derek up off the couch. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Andy knew he couldn't hide his thoughts all the time from them, and knew the Frost sisters were quickly. If he couldn't keep them from looking into his mind, he'd make it a place they would never want to see. By thinking like a regular hormonal teenager, not thinking excessively crude disgusting ones but what he honestly thought.  With a couple eccentric impulses, and things he thought was attractive. Nothing too bad but enough to make Phoebe cringe, and Sophie rolls her eyes at him and act annoyed. And it helped that his room was close to theirs.    Giving them the ideas they wish they could forget. For example looking back at when he first saw them he action he thought ' They're terrifyingly attractive. And the whole speaking at once or after each other is kinda hot.'   He had his way of screwing with them and they had no idea. Because they hated what was going inside his head and that's just how he liked it. At least until Esme figured out and  the telepaths cruelly  retaliated. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It started out as a relaxing walk while they were both on their lunch breaks. Anya realized though that whenever she sped up slightly Kate would match her pace. So she decided to experiment. She continued to speed up until they were both jogging. Kate doesn’t give any indicator that she is confused by what is occurring. Then without warning Kate begins to run. As soon as Anya catches up to her, Kate abruptly stops and sits down on a nearby park bench.   “What took you so long?” She jokes, as Anya sits down next to her. Whilst Anya tried to think of a response, Kate checked her watch.   “Sorry I have to go, I have to be in court in half an hour, but we should definitely do this again sometime soon.” She gives her girlfriend a quick kiss before walking away.   “Kate?” She calls out.  “Yes?”  “Next time I’m going to beat you.” *~*TEXT*~*

As Xander fluffed his lines, as Buffy got the characters’ names wrong, and as Willow fled the stage in terror, Giles could be forgiven for watching the performance through his fingers, but instead, he was looking at Buffy as if he was seeing her for the first time. With her golden hair styled and her ivory toga draped over her, he was noticing, for the first time, just how beautiful she truly was, like Aphrodite made flesh. Giles’ face fell into his hands. Oh this wasn’t good. *~*TEXT*~*

Yakov replied with something between a grouchy greeting and a grunt, and Celestino tutted in mock regret. ‘Only fifty, and already a grumpy old man.’     Yakov glared at his grinning pupil over the rim of his mug.  ‘ Must  you keep your hair like that?’ he grumbled, gesturing to the strand of unrestrained hair arching forth from Celestino’s forehead, ‘You look like one of those ugly deep sea fish.’     ‘Why, thank you!’ Celestino smiled winningly, ‘ You , of course, have all the grace and charm of an elephant seal.’ Yakov gave a disdainful  humph .     ‘I love you too, Yakov.’ *~*TEXT*~*

Lord Kallig drummed their fingers on the observation deck's railing, a disappointing lack of reaction.   "Always negative, Vitiate. You'll find our sith very fond of bugs," Horak-mul said.  "Go away, Horak-mul," Darth Andru drawled, "this is a private conversation."  The moment was ruined. Tenebrae had never given so many unappreciated speeches before. This had been a terrible idea. *~*TEXT*~*

La Madeline," he rolled the words of the brand together, said it easily. Train could tell he'd been practicing the french. His naked enthusiasm made it difficult to continue past the edge of the window. This reluctance was an irrational feeling. They were seven stories up and backing out would mean a messy end on the pavement. He hadn't planned for an immediate exit. Creed was dangerous and predatory-- --Train didn't need an exit, this was the rendezvous. --Remaining in the window would draw attention. --It didn't matter, he could take Creed in a fight. Train made himself climb all the way into the room. Creed smiled at him and held up a chocolate. It wasn't a nice smile. "Would you like one?" Train needed this partnership to work. He wouldn't get noticed if he couldn't work with others. If he wasn't noticed he'd never advance past needing help. They'd been together for months and Creed had backed him up with vigilant savagery every op. Sharing food fostered connections. Train liked chocolate. He wet his lips, "Is there any milk?" *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Sometimes, her new master was kind. There was an absentmindedness to it, like he didn't know what it meant when he held her through her tears or brushed her hair. He glared at her without comprehension when she thanked him, like he couldn't hear her.  Sometimes, he got an evil look in his eye. He stared past her and his face twisted away from its usual resentment and into something closer to hate. His skin lost its color and his breath went shallow. It was like he was sick with it, with all his anger.  Something was cracked in him. *~*TEXT*~*

Yet as she sat through the long-awaited performance of The Golden Demon, she found herself looking not at Shih Ming, easy on the eyes though he was, but Ru-Yueh. Gone was the girl who scampered offstage long before her exit: there was no mistaking the kimono-clad starlet who gazed remorsefully into the audience, hands clasped to her chest, as anyone other than Omiya.  If Wan-Hua was slow to stand during the ovation, no one else within the theatre noticed. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The water still runs and slowly drips Heavy breaths still hang between your lips And my arms still burn from your sound grip I need to know why you never let me slip You asked for my trust and I said no I thought you’d let me drown down below I couldn’t believe you would follow How should I have known you wouldn’t let me go? Both our hearts hammered hard in our chests When the water rose over our necks It wasn’t the first time I fought death But this time I wasn’t alone in the depths I’m still numb but no more paralyzed My legs still shake from the look in your eyes When your gaze meets mine; I never realized How easily you strip me of my disguise How can you risk something so precious Your own life, for mine, for something less Because after all, I caused this mess You take the words from my mouth, leave me breathless I don’t have a single tiny clue Why you do all the things that you do I’ve never met anyone like you I shouldn’t trust you, I can’t trust you But I do. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Things are pretty tense, it’s been just a few days since William buried his parents, found out he is adopted and that aliens exist. He is with Mulder and Scully and they are talking about something that sounds pretty serious. William feels very uncomfortable and just wants to go home. Then he hears that apparently someone is called... deep throat? He can’t hold his laugh. It feels good because he hasn’t laughed in awhile, and it’s the first time Mulder and Scully see him laughing like that, actually, laughing at all. So they join him, because that  is  a damn stupid name. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Smooth movements, gliding across the ice. The chill here is crisp and welcome. The air is smooth, it does not hinder you.  Here, the world is simple. There is no show to put on, no one to entertain. This is for you, and that's okay. The world is smooth here, and though you always end up back where you started, you do not mind.  It's right where you wanted to be.  Lift off the ground, just for a moment. Close your eyes, spin, and feel weightless. Let the arms of the wind hold you safe, trust in them, and land on the ice again with a 'clack' that echoes in the empty space.  Hear the soft 'shush' of the skates as you come to a stop. Breathe.  Open your eyes and take it all back in, ground yourself again.  You are safe, and here, and real.  And it's all okay. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*I was dead lucky to fall in with sprinkles888 for this challange - her fic is not only full of Sam, it's got loads of lovely imagery of all kinds. I was spoiled for choice! Click on the banner to read the story on AO3     Tha banner was the first and main illustration I did, but then I squeezed in a couple more. They aren't spoilers for the narrative, so you can view without fear. For fun, here's a close up of the triceratops     A campfire scene from later in the fic, with stargazing boys     And a divider     This is supposed to be looking inside Sam's duffel (in case you were wondering). Thanks to sprinkles for her patience, I was a bit all over the place with this one. Process is pretty simple this time - all the art is all traditional. The two illustrations are watercolour with a little digital added (some highlights and shadows on the car scene, and the background on the campfire one). The divider was drawn in ball point pen and then coloured with watercolours. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*That was exactly what Roger needed at this precise moment. Hearing Rafa’s voice. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Dubai  The hot temperatures of that ephemeral city plunged Roger in a deep sleep for several hours. He didn’t exactly know where he was but he vaguely heard Rafa’s voice and the sea sound in his sleep.  *  “Roger!”, said the voice a first time. But the Swiss wasn’t responsive. “Roger please wake up!” Mirka insisted. Still, he barely opened his eyes. “Roger!  The kids are here” And this time, he definitely woke up. After all, he was still a dad on duty.  “Mirka, what time is it, please?” She eyed her watch. “Almost 4pm” “I must have been asleep for so long. Oh god!” He proceeded with a yawn. “I understand Rog” She said knowingly.  *  They were all eating out on the hotel terrace. The kids tried to mumble while eating but Roger stared with a disapproving look. Mirka was just amused by the whole circus.  Everything was said and done until Roger’s phone rang. So he excused himself and picked up the phone. In the beginning, there was no voice but after a few seconds a voice emerged through the phone, “Hi!”.  That was exactly what Roger needed at this precise moment. Hearing Rafa’s voice. *~*TEXT*~*

Complied, Akashi took her down into the basement as he led her to a vault.  “Here is the first Precious ever contained by SGS. It was called that because the monster they took it from referred to it by that name.” Akashi showed her a small golden ring resting on a red pillow. *~*TEXT*~*

But one day the light burnt me, My graceful wings ached terribly. It was the climax of my life, The time I thought I was ready to die.  And I lost myself in pain, I got to love it, I got insane. The more it burnt, the more I craved, But this path led me to my grave.  My graceful wings at last stopped still, But I couldn’t help my insanity And day by day, piece by piece I got to lose my graceful wings.   I used to be a butterfly, But now I’m nothing but a lie. My graceful wings I hold to me To cherish what I could have been.  “It’s all their fault,” I tell myself. “It’s all  their  doing,  they  cut your flesh.” But it’s no use, I still believe I could’ve been a different me.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Of course.  Giorno was a shrike. Beautiful yet violent, the white of his breast oft stained with the wine red of a fallen foe. And Fugo was the thorn, the barbed wire, ugly and painful yet somehow useful to this precious thing. He held down their problems as Giorno pulled them apart with a surgeon's precision, and Fugo felt as if he finally had a purpose. Perhaps the shrike could work alone, but he was better with his thorn. The thorn, on the other hand was nothing without his shrike, nothing but a pain, causing damage to those who came to him, whether he planned to or not.  Yet, Giorno saw those ugly parts, made them useful and worthwhile, and perhaps with this care, this attention, Fugo would one day bloom. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The heat of summer was barely beginning to hit.  Sweat and sweltering headaches were just the start of Izuku’s worries, clouding his actual fears and revelations. Why bother with them when he’s got other things to focus on?  Like cooling himself down.  Like not thinking about All Might, and how the heat had affected the man that morning.  Blood and sweat and just a pinch of tears.  Again, he’s falling into his thoughts, brows pinching and his mouth settling into a hard line.   Had the man seen how Izuku had stared? He’d hardly been subtle, had even made a puff of noise at All Might dousing himself after a particularly long jog.  He’d... gotten the tiniest bit of a look. At least, Izuku thinks he did. It might just be his mind hoping that it’d been something more there than a smirk and a little roll of his eyes, like maybe the man was completely aware of what he was doing to the boy. Sometimes, it seems he knows.  All Might has to know.  If he doesn’t, then he has to be the densest man alive. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The small apartment was quiet when Steve opened the door. It felt too empty. It wasn’t the first time Steve had been alone at night, but now there was no promise of Bucky coming home. It didn’t matter that Bucky tried to make that promise to him; he could get killed his first night there and Steve might never know… or even if Bucky was able to return to Brooklyn, there was no guarantee that Steve would survive long enough to see him. There were too many things that could go wrong for either of them, and Steve saw only one way to maybe have a chance of seeing Bucky again. Enlisting in the army. He had to try again. He just had to. It wasn't only so he could do his part. It was a big part of it, but Steve needed to be by Bucky's side. Together to the end of the line, right? The silence that accompanied him now was deafening. His hands curled into fists. He couldn’t hear Bucky’s laughter, his teasing, his concern… nothing. Bucky was gone, and there was no life here without Bucky. The door was shut. He needed to try again. *~*TEXT*~*

If River didn’t know who she was this time, she was going to grab her vortex manipulator and send River to Earth’s sun.  She kissed River, her hearts against River’s hearts.  River kissed her back, a smile on her face.  But she bit River’s nose for good measure.  “Hello, Missy,” River said.  “Biting the nose was unnecessary.”  “Did you miss me?”  “No,” River said before going back for another kiss. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Stiles rubbed his thumb over the ring, his thoughts leading him into the future. “Son, what are you doing?” “Sorry, Dad.” Stiles held up his hand and tapped the silvery object on his finger. “It’s distracting.” “Yes. Well, congratulations again, but you’re on the job.” “Um, that’s actually why I came in. Derek’s meeting me for lunch.” “Are either of you doing your  actual jobs  today?” Stiles wouldn’t remind his father he’d been young and in love once. It was too happy a day for a reminder like that. “Probably not!” Stiles cheered, saluting before running out of the office. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Robert had been married to Cora for 27 years. They’d had their ups and downs, but, for the most part, they had been happily married. They had settled into a comfortable home life and had three daughters, but, since their miscarriage, things had cooled somewhat. They still slept together, but the passion was gone.   Then Robert had met Jane. Her calm and gentle manner resonated with Robert in ways he couldn’t explain. The way she made him feel when they were alone, her raven beauty and longing gaze awakened passions Robert thought long dead. Robert had never felt such temptation. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*"I expect in a few days to go to Philadelphia for a day or two. I shall there see my friend [Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens] and make him participate in my good fortune by giving him a picture of my mistress." - Alexander Hamilton to Elizabeth Schuyler, 27 October 1780  Exactly 200 words of Laurens being passive-aggressive about the wedding *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Her only striking feature is her black eyes, lively and good-natured but wanting something in intensity, in passion. She is pleasing and not without a becoming unadorned innocence about her, but nothing in the portrait explains how Miss Schuyler has snared Hamilton so. She must have the sweetness of a Venus to inspire marriage in such a man. Is his friend now a Paris, awarding the Golden Apple to the wrong contender, condemning his countrymen to a bitter fate?  “How the topless towers of Ilium burn,” Laurens says simply, giving him the miniature back.  “You dislike her,” Hamilton answers, and is not contradicted. “There’s no need for that. She’s a good girl I can give my heart to, but I do not give it whole. She’s not your better.”  “Yet she’s better in virtue of being a she. I believe it was you who said Cupid and Hymen now work together. But haven’t you heard? Cupid rules us all, but Hymen in his wisdom sanctifies only proper matches. I must yield and bear it like a man.”  “You forget I’m here with  you .”  “And it’s tearing you apart, is it not?”  And that is all there’s left to be said. *~*TEXT*~*

Derek drew in a sharp breath on the screen of his laptop. ”What was that?”  ”What?” Stiles asked, confused.  ”Your finger, what did you do?”  ”Oh.” Stiles frowned down at his hand. ”I got my string, but I don’t know who it leads to.”  ”Stiles?” Derek held his hands up and touched his right index finger, and Stiles’ heart tickled again. *~*TEXT*~*

He squared his shoulders, looked Stiles in the eyes, tried to look confident and unaffected.  ”You could move in here,” he said and lifted a shoulder in a shrug.  Stiles’ smile turned minutely soft, fond, strangely hopeful, then he cleared his throat, nodded.  ”Yeah. But you-, uh.” He looked around Derek’s apartment. His one bedroom apartment.  ”I have a big bed,” Derek blurted and his face flushed hotly. ”And I mean, the couch. It’s comfortable.” *~*TEXT*~*

"I seem to have a talent." Moxie dramatically rolled her eyes. "You are still as much of a troublemaker as you have always been, Snicket." "Some argue that I became a bigger troublemaker as the years went by." Lemony sighed. "Moxie, I need your help." "It's not another of your fragmented plans, is it?" She raised an eyebrow. "No, no. It's something very straightforward. And I really need a great reporter to help me." "It's good you are friends with the greatest reporter of Stain'd-by-the-sea and all surrounding region." She said, with pride. Lemony raised his eyes, meeting hers for the first time. "Are we still friends?" "Of course we are! You didn't think you could get rid of me so easily, did you? Now, tell me all about this trouble you are in." *~*TEXT*~*

Derek rumbled deep in his chest before moving up to Stiles’ neck and placing a kiss on another mole. Stiles shivered underneath him and tugged softly on his hair. Derek lifted his head. Stiles’ eyes were partially open and he had a soft smile on his face. “I love you,” Stiles whispered.  “I love you, too,” Derek replied, then kissed the tip of Stiles’ nose. *~*TEXT*~*

It's his life and his death, and death, and death. When he stretches out on another lumpy mattress in another lonely town, he stares into the darkness. He listens to the pounding of his heart, waiting for the final bang. *~*TEXT*~*

He looked back and saw the destruction of Asgard, the immolation of his homeland. It was a violent, fearsome, terrifying thing. So much he had loved was lost. But, he thought, as he looked around him, not everything was lost. The people were frightened but not despairing; their hearts were damaged but would heal. Even with half his sight, he could see the way forward. He took his seat and turned from the past, looking to the future. *~*TEXT*~*

How long have you been standing there?” Dean asked taken by surprise. “It was Y/N.”    Mary smiled warmly at him. She knew it.

Mary laughed.  “You know, when we get back to the bunker, I should ask Kitten if she wants to do a girl’s night,” Mary teased Dean as his eyes widened and a blush crept over his face.   “Well, I guess the cat’s out of the bag,” Dean chuckled as he pulled out onto the highway headed for home and his Kitten.  *~*TEXT*~*

In her sure and tender comfort, I feel my troubles flee   But my baby belongs to another    and I would never take her from he. But My love, my rock, my home, my soul - she will ever be. For she sets the wayward spirit free   *~*TEXT*~*

You got an answer?” “I like tea when it’s cold out,” she said, “and soda when it’s warm, but I’m not picky on flavor.” “Okay.” Kasie hesitated, then said, “You know, you don’t have to treat me just like Abby.  You two were close, and we’ve only just met.” “Yeah,” Gibbs allowed.  “But how do you think we got close?” “Oh.”  She smiled.  “That’s a good point.” “Yeah,” he repeated.  “So, tell me about you.” THE END *~*TEXT*~*

Don’t be so- you! It’s a party.” Beast boy said as he transformed back and sat down next to him throwing an arm over his shoulders.  “Guess who got pizza!” Cyborg shouted getting cheers from the others.  “Robin, are you having fun?” Starfire asked as she flew over to the boy wonder who was looking out of the window.  “Yeah, I am Star.” Robin said grabbing her hand. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Catra's tail was hanging over the edge of the top bunk. Feeling a little catlike herself at the impulse, Adora batted at it. The tail immediately twitched up out of sight. From across the darkened room came familiar raspy reptilian snores. The cadet barracks were loud when most of the others were asleep, let alone each morning at reveille. Catra didn't snore, but was likely sprawled to take up maximum space. Not that Adora could see from her viewpoint. When Catra wordlessly eased herself down on to Adora's bunk and curled up, Adora knew they would both sleep more soundly. *~*TEXT*~*

And I think, even if it’s never gonna be my  favourite  thing in the world, I can be glad it happened.”  Hunter breathed out a shaky chuckle, relieved.   “You  think ?” He rose an eyebrow, voice mostly joking.

His arms wrapped around you as well, one of his hands coming to rest on the back of your head, his eyes closing.  “I missed you Darlin.”   You nodded and smiled against his chest.   “I missed you too Jackson.”   You finally separated from each other and he held the beer out to you.   “Nice and cold.”   You laughed and took the bottle from him, taking a swig before handing it to him to take a sip.   “Such a bad influence.”   He gave that famous Teller smirk that you’d all mastered and shrugged, throwing an arm over your shoulders, leading you over to the couch to catch up.   “That’s what big brothers are for.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Kate showed up to a meeting one morning wearing a white shirt and denim jacket. It wasn’t her intention nor did the clothes belong to her. Roger had called this meeting two hours ago and after spending the night at Anya’s she hadn’t been given enough notice to be able to go home and change and still make it in time. The only set of clothes she had on her other than her pajamas were too dirty to wear. So instead Anya had lent her the clothes she was wearing now.  It wasn’t something she usually would pick for herself and she didn’t own anything like it. Surprisingly she didn’t feel self conscious when she first entered the office. There was something calming that felt nice about wearing her girlfriend’s clothes something that made her feel closer to her.  She returns to Anya’s apartment that night.  “You look good in that.”  “Thanks.” She blushes.  “Hey would I be able to borrow this again some time?”  “ Sure if you like it but under one condition.”  “What’s the condition?”  “ That I get to borrow one of your blazers.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It wasn’t  quite  the same. It was still a damned good look. Zeb let his eyes trail over Kallus’ lean form, again enrobed in Imperial black. Zeb might hate the Empire, but damn did they tailor their uniforms well. Glossy boots hugged long calves, snug trousers shaping muscular legs, tunic taut across broad shoulders and tight around narrow waist. Zeb licked his lips, catching Kallus’ golden gaze. He leered, and was rewarded by the faintest of blushes on those high cheekbones.   When everything went to shit and they fled into the caves, Zeb grabbed Kallus’ arm and tugged him deeper into the shadows. Roughly, he pinned the former Imperial against the wall. He could feel Kallus panting, his body flushed with heat.   Zeb nuzzled close, grinning when he heard the quiet whine that escaped Kallus. To anyone else, the sound would be inaudible. But Zeb was pressed close to the man, and had excellent hearing. Zeb huffed softly, letting his breath warm Kallus’ neck above that high collar. Kallus’ breath stuttered. Zeb grinned. Yeah, his man looked good in black, and when they were all safe back at base, Zeb would make sure to let him know just how much. *~*TEXT*~*

They each took a drink—Yang from her mug, Uncle Qrow from his flask. “I’m proud of her,” Uncle Qrow said, nodding in the direction of Ruby. “Me too,” said Yang, smiling. “At this rate, Summer and Oscar are gonna be better fighters than me in a couple months.” Yang set down her mug and stared at the table. “You did it again.” “…Oh.”   “Do you ever get scared?” Yang asked, sitting on the couch with her hands clasped together. “Nope,” Uncle Qrow said without missing a beat. “…Really?” He sighed. “All the time. But, as the responsible adult here, I shouldn’t be talking about that with you, kiddo.” He laughed, but it wasn’t a happy one.   “You, responsible? I don’t believe it.” Now  there  was his real laugh. “Not everyone can be fearless, Yang.” He looked at Ruby, asleep on the couch. “Not everyone can be like her. Summer’s something special.” Yang saw her uncle’s smile and bit her lip. “Yeah, she is.” *~*TEXT*~*

Before you know it, I’ll have corpses in my drawing room and cobwebs in the library.”     He chuckled in response before leaning forward to brush his nose against hers.     “I am yours.”     She sighed and delighted in the words she would never grow tired of hearing.     "Does that make you a corpse or a cobweb, then?"     Fenris let out a long-suffering groan. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Madara can see many things in the coals. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Madara inhaled deeply, then he closed his eyes. Images were flashing through his brain, some blurry, others oh so sharp. Hard to make sense out of them for now. Until one in particular caught his attention and his breathing hitched in his throat. “What is it ?” his brother’s voice inquired, sounding so distant despite knowing Izuna was sitting right beside him, by the fireplace. Izuna had wanted to stay by his side, during the whole session, for as long as the coals would be burning, for as long as he would be seeing and Madara was thankful. He had done this on his own, once upon a time. It almost killed him, because of the intensity of his visions. “I’ve seen him,” Madara breathed out, his voice rough, his throat hurting. He had seen him indeed and what a beauty he was. Hair white as the snow, traits sharp as the blade Madara always wore at his belt. “Who ?” Izuna inquired, his tone worried and Madara smiled. “The man I will marry.” He didn’t have his name yet. Only one clear image of him but Madara didn’t need more to find him. And he’d marry him indeed. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The ophthalmologist delivers news. Nothing actually new, though. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“I’m afraid I don’t have good news,” the ophthalmologist spoke as he movesd away from his instruments, raw concern showing on his old face, or so Madara pictured. “Tell me something new,” Madara joked and he yelped when his lover pinched his waist. “What was that for ? We’ve known I was going blind forever, it’s hardly a surprise.” “You are the worst,” Tobirama rolled his eyes or at least, the off focus image of him did. Madara tried not to squint to take in as many details as he could. But he said the truth, didn’t he ? His sight had been going down ever since he was born after all, it was a miracle he wasn’t already blind and Madara had no regret. He was living with an amazing man, they had a beautiful house together, a dog, four cats and lots of nieces and nephews to spoil. What could he possibly ask for more ? “Thank you, Love.” Tobirama huffed but he kissed the top of his head and grabbed his hand. It was going to need some adjusting, of course. But Madara could do anything, as long as Tobirama believed in him. Anything and everything. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Iruka is tired. Gai, obviously, isn't. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“What do you mean it won’t fit !?” Gai’s usual energy levels already were hard to handle on a daily basis. But Iruka was so damn tired at the moment. For Gai had asked him to take literally everything they owned out of the moving van thrice already. He seemed to be fixed on the idea that they could make only one trip to their new flat, if they rearranged their furnitures the right way for it all to fit in the van. Iruka knew better. “Listen, Gai, we’ve tried, it doesn’t fit,” he stated, slumping his shoulders and eyeing his husband pace to-and-fro in front of the van’s open doors at a suicidal speed. “I’m tired. Let’s just make it in two trips.” “Never! Kakashi moved in one trip, I can do it as well !” Iruka rolled his eyes, he shook his head. “Kakashi lives like a monk and only owns a bed and a fridge.” Gai started to pout, crossing his arms. It was hard to resist, when he did that, Iruka knew and, he sighed. “Alright. One last time.” “You’re the best !” Gai yelled, probably startling the whole neighborhood in the process. “Now, let’s start with the table!” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 2  A little drabble about how Miranda might be feeling after she passes through Chase's holo-form. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Miranda doesn’t know what to do.  She still talks with Chase’s mother and sister every week, watching dinners she can’t eat, watching Dri get taller, watching her dead boyfriend’s loved ones go through their lives.  She was given one week of leave. She could have gone home to family, but she didn’t. She brought Dri a model of the plane Chase used to pilot; she brought his mother platitudes she didn’t feel, that she felt compelled to say anyway.  Now, of course, that all feels for nothing. It could have been Chase watching his sister grow older under siege, not her.  (What do you do? This isn’t like an ancient movie, where the hero dies out at sea, though the grieving hurts just as much.) *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Hank thinks the only way to make this fostering scheme work is for Charles to erase the kids' memories as they leave the mansion, but Charles refuses to do it, even for the kids who stay for only a few nights – too haunted by what he did to Moira. But Corey, Kathryn and all the children that follow them are so visibly relieved to find a place where they can push themselves around, explore and feel at home, that Hank comes to accept that they'll keep the mansions’ secrets. Like Charles, he does his best for them, having learned from his students that it's about ability, whether you're a disabled or mutant kid. *~*TEXT*~*

Silver shook his head, “No, it’s fine. I have to get used to her being gone, I guess the best way is by remembering her in my memories.” Silver giving her a smile.  “You don’t have to force yourself, Silver,” Luna said.   Yeah, but hiding from my problems won’t help me either.” Silver started “Blaze gave me, no all of us this new start.  It’s time for me to take advantage of it.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*DI Jamie Cross ran an open door policy in his office.   If the door was shut his team knew he was only to be disturbed in the event of a Level 3 catastrophic emergency, as defined by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, or alternatively a severe shortage of chocolate biscuits.  If the door was open, it meant any bugger could disturb him.  “Guv, phone for you!” DS Stevie Milner yelled. “Some woman says she’s got a baby triceratops in her garden!”  Cross winced. So much for keeping his new hush-hush attachment to a top-secret government agency quiet.  “Put her through!” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Mahoney is on her way to open up the Wonder Emporium from the Mutant's place with the beginnings of a sonata or maybe more in her mind. It emerged after she said goodbye to him, making her barely notice the bus ride. Suddenly afraid the idea is too restless a thing and the succession of notes that came to her will fly right back out of her mind if she doesn’t get it down, she reaches inside her purse for a sheet and realizes it’s her date purse. She looks up in consternation. But there, out of the corner of her eye – and she can hear Mr Magorium saying that sometimes that’s the best view – she spots a tiny music store that she knows she's never seen on this street before and suspects she'll never find again. Mahoney smiles, a twinkle in her eye, and rushes out of her seat. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*I don't own Batman TAS characters.           One smile materialized on Baby-Doll's face after she approached a candy shop. Her eyes were on a variety of chocolate in a window. She checked any dress pockets. A frown formed when she discovered she didn't have any money at all. Baby-Doll wasn't worried. There were two things to use. A cute smile. Her catchphrase from Love That Baby. ''I didn't mean to.'' How she was able to obtain candy. Baby-Doll began to place her tiny arms behind her back. One cute smile. She watched while people walked by her. Although they didn't recognize her from Love That Baby, the fact didn't seem to bother her. Not at all. She shook her head at a snail's pace. ''I didn't mean to.'' A woman paused and smiled near Baby-Doll. ''What a cute girl!'' she said. The woman opened a purse and reached into it. After revealing a candy ball, she gave it to Baby-Doll and departed. Baby-Doll continued to smile before she ate the new candy. Her eyes widened. She scowled. ''Naughty Mr. Sour Candy!''   THE END *~*TEXT*~*

This was one of the most beautiful things that someone has ever told him.  Today was another day for sure. He was there standing on the podium watching Novak enjoying his trophy. It’s been a while since he won it. Last time was against Roger and what a ride it was. Defeating Roger after so many hours played against each other and watching his rival cry because the defeat was too much to bear for one single man.  10 years later, they were not just rivals but friends and lovers. Despite everything, they’d get over their unfortunate results because after all those years they wouldn’t thank enough tennis. Not just because they were tennis players but tennis has made the impossible: finding each other. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The film hasn't even started yet when Kaname suddenly feels his boyfriend's large hand cover his own on the armrest between them. It almost makes him jump out of his seat in surprise, but he somehow manages to control himself. “What are you doing?” he whispers, turning to look at Ushijima who simply raises an eyebrow. “We're on a date. Isn't holding hands something you do on a date?” It is, but it isn't something they've done in public until now. But the more Kaname thinks about it, he realises what a perfect opportunity this is. They are in a dark cinema, and once the film starts, nobody is going to pay attention to them anyway. Mustering all of his courage, Kaname flips his own hand beneath Ushijima's so they can properly link their finger together. In response, Ushijima flashes one of his rare smiles – just a little quirk at the corners of his mouth, but enough to send Kaname's heart racing.   *~*TEXT*~*

He let out an agitated groan at that, then sat up in bed and extended a hand towards the book that was resting on his nightstand, hoping it would help ease his distress.          He jumped a little when he heard a floorboard creak loudly and turned to see that Mabel was out of bed and gazing at him with an alarmed look on her face.  "Did I wake you?" She asked, her voice soft and uncharacteristically quiet. "I'm sorry if I did, I just couldn't sleep or stop thinking about… y'know…" She trailed off, clutching her pajama shirt tightly.  Dipper shook his head, smiling faintly. He had a feeling they were both being troubled by the same thing.  Weirdmaggedon.  "No, it's fine." He reassured her. "I haven't been able to sleep much either. *~*TEXT*~*

When their hands touch,  Whole Lotta Love  starts playing in his head. “I didn’t know you could do that,” Dean says quietly. “There’s a lot of things you still don’t know about me, Dean.” Dean puffs out a laugh. That’s probably true but he can’t help thinking that he knows Cas better than anyone. The fact that there’s still things he has yet to learn about Cas is both exciting and disheartening. No one knows Cas better than Dean. “Stop thinking, Dean.” Shit, can Cas hear him thinking? “Yes,” Cas replies aloud. “I can feel your heart rate increasing too.” “Shut up. Just play the music,” Dean grunts, tightening his grip on Cas’ hand.  I’m glad you’re back , Dean hears Cas’ voice in his head.  Glad to be back . *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Draco's trying to pop the question. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*From the shake of Hermione's shoulders, she thought the tremble in his hands was hilarious. "Draco," she said, her voice infuriatingly calm. "I'm going to accept. We really don't need to do this whole--" "I want to," he said. He fought the ring box from his pocket and snapped it open. "If I can just-- dammit !" The ring landed in a patch of moonlight, a cheeky sparkle in the grass. Snorting, Hermione flung her arms around him. "Yes," she said. "Try not to drop the ring at the wedding." He sighed and dropped his head on her shoulder. "No promises." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Just a look into Sweet's mind. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Sometimes Sweets thought that everyone thinks he's innocent. Naive. Like he isn't a therapist for the FBI. Like he hasn't studied gory and gruesome cases. Delved into the darkest part of the human phycie to help put murderers away.  He thought that after they got to know him, saw that he was a professional, that they would loosen up around him. At the very least he thought that they would come to respect him. And they did, in a way. They liked him, sometimes came to him with their problems... But whenever he says something about any type of phycological human condition, they scoff first. And then when he gets something right, it wasn't because he's a phycologist. No it had to do in   some way   with anthropology.  He just wished that they acknowledge that they weren't the only geniuses there. You don't hear him continuesly say that he's the youngest phycologist to be hired by the FBI. Or that he has several doctorits. But, he's sure that they will respect his expertise. Eventually. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It's the future. Of course you can walk. And run, fight, shoot, threaten, and all other activities associated with being Gotham City's Police Commissioner.  Most cops nowadays haven't known any Commissioner Gordon but you. You don't know how you feel about that. You are married, somewhat surprisingly. To the DA, somewhat unsurprisingly.  You do things by the book. No bad cops in your force, and no capes in your city. It's not perfect, but it shouldn't be. It's Gotham.  You sleep well. At night, the chip in your neck gives you back the memories you stashed in there, and connects your sleeping brain to the hidden remote terminals in your headboard. You are Oracle for the night, a ghost in the network, a lucid dream you don't remember when you wake up. There's only the vaguest of memories of having dreamed. Sometimes fresh insights about cases, bits of intuition you don't try to explain. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*He can't forget her. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*She stuck in his mind, wrapped around his memories. Her voice raised over the din of students in the Great Hall, her eyes flashing in determination. He tried to shove those thoughts away, to wall them up and block them off. He was trained in Occlumency, trained to forget parts of his own mind, but nothing ever worked. All it took was a hint of perfume, the flick of long dark hair, the curl of a smile, and he was lost again. When he finally surrendered, let her in, he wondered why he'd tried to forget. She was worth remembering. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He stood in the garden, the sun a brilliant orange against his closed eyes. The war was over, the trials were done. For the first time in months, he could breathe freely. He tipped his head back and pushed up his sleeves. No shadows, no darkness, no chill in his bones, no ice in his soul. Arms held wide, he let the heat roll over him and he reveled in the sun on his skin. He felt the warmth soaking into his body, heat filling all the dark places in his mind. He was as free and light as sunshine. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Harrow hissed as his mother dragged him down the hall by his ear, scolding him for sneaking into the bakery to "ruin his appetite" on sweets.   "You know better than to sneak in there and steal, Harrow."   The young prince grunted; he didn't see the problem, it had only been one sweet cake. That would hardly kill his appetite.   He wondered how she had found out, he had been so careful, so quiet, so sneaky. The only thing he could think of was that someone, maybe one of the staff, had spotted him and told his parents. He couldn't believe he had been told on like that.   "Mom-"   "Harrow," his mother cut him off sharply. "I won't hear any of your excuses. You're in big trouble this time young man."   Harrow groaned, there was no way he was going to talk his way out of this one. He fell silent and simply marched along with his mother toward his room. He wondered how long his punishment would last this time.   Viren would never let him live this down. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Sometimes Ford’s thoughts bloom with scientific and paranormal insights that can’t possibly come from the world that he knows.  In other moments, words and phrases occur to him in an alien language that he can’t understand but can  feel , like the queasy sensation of stepping off a precipice, or trying to imagine the inside of a black hole.  He can’t resist asking his muse about them.  “How does it feel to think in my voice, IQ?” Bill circles Ford at eye level as the Mindscape shimmers around them.  “Is this how you see the universe?” Ford asks, hardly daring to hope.  “Not even close!” Bill hoots.  “Even  your  brain couldn’t handle more than a tiny taste.  Come on, don’t give me that face!” he protests as Ford frowns.  “I’m just looking out for you, pal!”  “Of course.”  Ford bows his head.  “Your inspiration is a gift, and I’m sorry for doubting you.”  “That’s A-okay!” Bill ruffles his hair.  “If you ask me real nicely, maybe we can find out how much your mind  can  take!” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Narcissa leaned forward. "Promise me," she said, her voice taut, half-choked. "Promise, Draco. No matter what you must say, no matter what you must do, you must come through this alive. Tell whatever lies are necessary, lie to everyone you have ever met, but promise me that you will live." He dropped his head, unable to meet her eyes. Instead he stared at the tip of the fresh black mark. Looking at it was easier than looking at the fear in her face. He swallowed hard and took her hand. Slowly, he nodded, his heart pounding. "I promise," he lied. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Waiting for judgement. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The verdict was coming. The rest of his life, freedom or prison, would be decided in the next few minutes. Draco looked at the audience without moving his eyes. He knew they were waiting to see him shiver, waiting for any hint of a tremble. He refused to let them have it. In the folds of his robes, he slowly curled his fingers into fists. He would not give them anything. Not a twitch, not a shudder. No matter the results, he would walk out without a hint of fear. He was terrified, yes, but they would never see it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*He has a choice. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*He wanted to slip away from the back of the crowd, to slither off through the dungeons and disappear. Take off, run away. What he'd seen and what he'd done - he wanted to forget. He wanted to be forgotten. He stood tense and trembling but he couldn't decide which way to go. His parents stood on the other side, their pale faces twisted up with desperate fear. He hesitated, torn. This was his chance, his choice. Maybe a last chance. His mother called to him. Her voice trembled, but she met his eyes steadily. He swallowed hard. Finally, he moved. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*anonymous asked: Prompt. How did Nott get her nose ring? Was it some coming of age thing goblins do? Do only goblin girls get them? Was it just an excuse to have more shiny things? Nott gets her piercings. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The goblins do more than make her one of them and force her to do whatever they tell her to do. They hold her down and pierce her awful fucking ears, forcing her to be still with their hands covering her mouth as they punch a hole in the middle of her nose.  The goblin she assumed was the wife, if they even have marriages or anything of the sort, of the one she killed was the one who ordered it be done to her only a week after she’d been forced back with them.  She said it was to claim her, to mark her as hers and the clans prize, as an extension to making her suffer. Her nose ring is used to pull her where they want her to go, and it hurts.  She eventually managed to escape, but she’s gotten used to the rings, and wouldn’t know how to remove her nose ring if she wanted to. Mostly, she just tried to pretend they weren’t there.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It all happened almost at once. Barbara opened the door, saw the Joker, heard a shot. The bullet went upwards through the Joker's head, killing him instantly. As his body dropped, Barbara could see an old woman standing behind him, gun still smoking. She smiled like a teenager, more so when she saw Jim come behind Barbara, his gun aimed at her. "You are welcome," she said to both, darting away from the door. Barbara let Jim run after her while she took a more indirect route. She was faster than the older woman, but she seemed to know all of her methods and tricks, probably -as much as it pained Barbara to admit it- better than herself. It was the first time they crossed paths with the woman who called herself Oracle. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“How about this one?”      Severus glanced over the top of his book at Remus and snorted.  “It looks like Hagrid set himself on fire.”     Remus studied the butchered pineapple, a meagre light shining through the holes that were meant to be eyes and a mouth.  “Hmm, yes, it does seem a tad macabre, even for Halloween.”  He swirled his wand and it disappeared.      “Give up, Lupin.  You will never achieve the talent I have for carving intricate details into inanimate objects.”     Remus spared a look at the outstanding piece of work in the corner of their chamber.  True, the pumpkin was quite magnificent, but he thought it gaudy.  And pumpkins were overdone.  He wanted something different.  “How about this?”         In his hand was now an avocado, carved in the shape of a skull, with the pit peeking through the eyes and nose.      “I hate guacamole.”     “All right, how about this, then?”         Severus was presented with a purple and white turnip, carved with a cheeky wink.  “Don’t even contemplate placing a flame inside that; it will smell like the Gryffindor locker-room after a Qudditch match.”     Remus smirked.  “Ah, you’re weakness – sweaty Gryffindors!”     Severus pulled him close.  “No, only one sweaty Gryffindor.” *~*TEXT*~*

The door opens and Hermione's there, pulling her hat off, unwinding her scarf, and looking his way. He's standing before he knows it and she's suddenly in his arms. "Missed you," he says into her hair. She holds him tight and smiles. *~*TEXT*~*

Wild laughter reached him on the gentle breeze. Scorpius climbed onto a boulder and danced with victory, grinning in the sun. Draco watched his son, and his pulse drummed in his ears. Scorpius laughed like he was formed entirely of joy. Worry and fear had never touched him, and if Draco had any power in the world, never would. For the first time in generations, one child, one Malfoy heir, would grow up free. *~*TEXT*~*

"You'll wash your feet before coming in?" "Your floors are safe from me." She danced closer and flicked rain at him with a grin. "Oops. Now you're wet too." He snickered. "Get out there, Granger," he said. "I love to watch you dance." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Week after week, in the cemetery. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*He walks slowly, in the cemetery, each foot placed with care, the full sweep of his cloak brushing over the close-cropped grass. Every visit, Draco starts at the first stone to the right of the gate. Head bowed, he places one hand on the smooth marble. He closes his eyes and he whispers. "I am sorry." He waits for a moment, then he moves on. Dozens of graves surround the memorial to those lost in war, and Draco stops to apologize to each. Week after week, he returns to offer up his regret, hoping to find forgiveness for his role. *~*TEXT*~*

"You do one Muggle thing of my choosing. I absolve you of Gryffindor social appearances for six months. Those were the terms."  "Your tactics are unfair, love. I'll agree to anything to get out of the wet spot."  "I know." She grinned at him, waggling the bottle. "Drink up. You might even like it." At his twisted expression, she giggled. "Well, you might.

*~*TEXT*~*How many years has it been since I last saw him?  Fifteen? Twenty?  It doesn’t matter now because he’s here in front of me. The way his eyes sparkle is unmistakable, he’s still the same quirkless boy who had dreams of being a hero.  However, his gaze isn’t directed at me. His fond smile is directed to his colleague. Those eyes will never look at me like that anymore, replaced by awkwardness and avoidance.  I remember the times where we used to be inseparable, where I let my pride take over and made me lose him. Years of experience had cooled me down and I see now the sins I’ve done to him.  It’s too late now.  He’s happy now and I couldn’t be more proud that he has grown throughout his suffering. He’s living a happy life, where I exist as his living nightmare.  I walked away.    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Charles and Erik stand at a crossroads, once again.  A short cherik inspired poem. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*   °°°  And here we are again,  At the crossroads of fate.  The paths grow darker  The longer that we wait.  We know how it’s played;  A familiar game  I go one way, you the other  It's always the same.  I step forward, the first  And send you a parting smile.  ‘Goodbye, old friend.’   You stand and stare for a while.  And then, inexplicably,  Our paths seem to coincide  ‘I meant what I said,’ you grin.   ‘I want you by my side.’   My heart is in my throat,  A traitorous blossom of hope  For all that has come to pass,  At the end of the rope.  Surely, this is a cruel joke,  The means to an end  How can I believe, now,  That you’re willing to bend?  Sandy shores, cerulean skies  The echo of a phantom pain,  How am I to know  That you won’t leave once again?  These words I hold back,  But you know me too well  When you lean in close  I am caught under your spell.  There’s a look in your eyes,  One I have not yet seen,  ‘Because, my love,’  you breathe,   ‘This time...   This time, we want the same thing.’  ●●● *~*TEXT*~*

He reached towards Uno’s glasses, and the other let him take them off his face and try them on. Uno didn’t even try stifling his giggles. “Jyuugo, you look like the worst librarian in the world!” Jyuugo retaliated by throwing Uno’s glasses at his face, smudging the lenses. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Harrow took a deep breath as he sat alone in his chambers. It was the Day of Remembrance and Harrow took this time to reminisce about his parents. It had been many years since their passing and Harrow was still struck by the pang of sadness that hit him in the chest.   Harrow thought back through his many memories of his family, from the walks through the courtyard they'd take, to sparring with his father, and learning with his mother. He took a deep breath and coughed when he noted the shakiness of his breath.   He supposed one never really got over the death of a parent, no matter how long ago or peaceful that death may have been. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Ruby usually looked up at her parents in something like awe. Not an unusual reaction for the child, but still. She found when she looked at them, with their magic eyes and shiny, sparkly bodies she would think that she must have the coolest parents ever.  At the moment however it was just her and her dad. Her dad was hurrying about the room, pacing and packing, also not an unusual occurrence. Ruby hoped they wouldn’t have to move homes again. She liked it here. Mom liked it here. Mom taught her and her friends all about maths and reading and the in-hair-ant rights of margarine-iced people. They had been happy and comfortable.  Dad started looking worried, which told Ruby it was time to step in. She walked up to him and pulled on his arm, stopping him on the spot. He turned his gaze on her, eyes obscured by his visor special visor she wasn’t allowed to touch. But he already began looking calmer.  “It’s alright dad. Whatever’s going on,” Ruby said. “We can fix it.”  He smiled, looking back at her, and said “I hope so.” *~*TEXT*~*

As the clock strikes one, the pale ghostly man seemed to have vanished in a shimmer, the swing stopped while it made weird creaking noises, which eventually stopped.  And now, the swing stopped and no-one was there, except for a memory of a time and a man long forgotten by time and pain. *~*TEXT*~*

Ever since he first saw her dancing  (graceful as a sonnet)   while that singer crooned about stupid things. Sooner or later, Spike’s going to have to do an incredibly stupid thing and tell her. Who knows? Maybe she even feels the same way: deep, deep down. Yeah. Right. *~*TEXT*~*

Tristana gulped audibly, hoping the panic in her face would deter the male yordles. It didn’t. However, a voice coming from behind her rekindled a hope that had been dwelling inside of her. “Yo, Trist! Wanna go visit Morgana’s cupcake shop?” “I’d love to!” The female turned around and quickly caught up to the yordle that called out to her. Poppy flicked her hair back as she watched the males look at her with a mixture of envy and disbelief on their faces. Once Tristana had surpassed her, she winked at them smugly before giving them a sassy hip shake as she walked away from them. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*It's posted in Hollow Knight since most people follow my Hollow Knight fics so I felt it was fitting there. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Ok hi. So basically, I am still alive. I havent been working on "She's safe there, cradled in your arms" or "Dawnbreak" for several reasons, mostly involving school, lack of motivation and stuff like that. I am hoping to get back to the former sooner or later, as of now the latter will remain the way it is right now, as i havent really developed any form of proper plotline aside from some bigger plot points.  I cannot say when I will get back to "She's safe there, cradled in your arms", as of recently writing the story became quite bitter for me due to reasons I won't disclose here and the fact that I haven't felt up to writing it.  "Cats and Wolves" remains as it is right now, with chapter 3 somewhat in pieces. I havent found the motivation to continue writing Dark Souls stuff, as I've been having a blockade with it.  I may or may not work on an Elder Scrolls fic sometime, though dont be sure of it yet.  That all for updates atm. I will hopefully return sooner than later, but no promises. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~* Ittetsu never regretted going on this mission more than he did in the moments when they had to turn off their gravitational field for maintenance. The novelty of floating through the space ship had quickly worn off and been replaced by motion sickness.  Luckily, there was someone who was always willing to keep Ittetsu company and distract him from his misery.  “You'd think you would've gotten used to being in zero gravity,” Ukai-kun said as he rubbed soothing circles on Ittetsu's back. “It's been three years since we left Earth.”  “We only turn off gravity twice a year,” Ittetsu tried to defend himself. “That's not enough time to get used to anything.”  Ukai-kun chuckled and kissed Ittetsu's cheek. “We'll be on our way back soon.”  Ittetsu closed and leaned his head against Ukai-kun's shoulder, listening as Ukai-kun told him about the friends he wanted to introduce to Ittetsu once they got back.    *~*TEXT*~*

With a flourish, the horn bill finishes, and waits for his release to return to his duties.   His beak nearly kisses the ground with the bow he takes, wings spread far as they can. For a moment, his eyes shut, then they open, filled with renewed energy.  “Very well, sire.” He says, petting the dirt mound, talons tamping upon gathered dust and leaves. “I will see you for the next morning report.” *~*TEXT*~*

And everything you'd put on him, everything you'd wanted him to be…)  (Are you any better than the Diamonds?)  (And it  shouldn’t  feel subversive with him, you don’t want it to. But it’s an admission that you’ll never fuse with her again, that she’s gone, and you  know  that, think perhaps you’ve finally accepted it...but what if, when you fuse with him, all you feel is her absence, is  disappointment ?)  (He deserves— you both  deserve—so much more than disappointment.)  You’ve both come so far. (Your Gem swells in a starburst of light.)

*~*TEXT*~*It’s ice water in your veins. Frost on your organs; a glacial crystallization on your heart. The cold doesn’t dissipate, even as you strain to remember the sun. Numbers run through your head, and you hold on to them like precious things.  72. No, 73?  Ever since the day you wandered down the steps, into this small, cramped space, you thought of the sun. You doze, sometimes, and in those moments, you almost remember the way the sun would rest atop your skin like silk. Heat swaddled you, sometimes too tightly. But it was beautiful.  You crave that embrace, now. As you wake up, the cold overwhelms you, like being buried in an avalanche where darkness embodies the frigid air. Where death feels inevitable.   Maybe it’s only 71.   If you hold on, you know the cold will disappear. The Cold. Your arms and legs will thaw, leaving behind soft, supple limbs eager for sunlight. You’ll blink at the white heat, be awed at the way the temperature rises with the sun. You’ll no longer thirst, tremble, feel this chilly ache.   71 , you decide. You hold the number tightly, counting down one more day. *~*TEXT*~*

A nervousness, an uncertainty. “I have to tell you something.” His voice is louder than usual, like he’s forcing the words out. “A day before this happened, before the graduation issue, I got an email from a publisher. They found the transcription. They’s excited about hos big Monstrous Sea is, and they want to be the ones to publish it in novel form.”  “They want to publish yours?”  He nods. I swipe my sleeve over my eyes. “That’s great. That’s awesome. That’s a book deal.”  “They said they want to work with the creator, too. Illustrated novel form, if you know what I mean.” *~*TEXT*~*

Yet, despite knowing this, he couldn’t help how she made him feel. Every moment they shared, every hug, every kiss, they made Giles’ heart sing. He should feel ashamed of himself, she was young enough to be his daughter, but, when he saw her again and she kissed him, he took her in his arms and lost himself in her. *~*TEXT*~*

Pale, slender fingers clutch the mask, nails scraping over the lenses. Tetsuya licks the blood off his lip.  “No, I don’t think you’re stupid, Seijuro.”  It’s just for a second—the spark of gold that surfaces in Seijuro’s left eye, the warning that shoots up the length of Tetsuya’s neck.  Stay away .  He resolutely ignores it, instead placing his hand over Seijuro’s, which trembles, gripping the scissors. His senses quiet and the gold disappears as quickly as it came.  “Do I mean anything to you?” It comes out as a whisper. Tetsuya doesn’t hesitate and wraps his arms around Seijuro.  “You mean   everything   to me.”     -     “Will you stop?”  Tetsuya doesn’t answer. Seijuro holds him closer. *~*TEXT*~*

So not cute.  “Why would I get bored?” Tobio shot back.  “Because you drink it all the freaking time? Like, you could go for strawberry milk instead. Or at the very least vanilla flavoured milk.”  Tobio shuddered at the thought. “Ugh, no! Those are sweet.”  Hinata threw his arms up in the air, gesticulating wildly.  “That's the point, though!”   He still isn't cute , Tobio told himself, even as a wave of fondness crashed over him.  And then Hinata added, “plain milk is just so boring,” and all fondness was replaced with annoyance again.  “You have no idea what you are talking about!” Tobio growled, slurping on his plain milk extra loudly just to spite this orange-haired idiot with no taste.    *~*TEXT*~*

Jesse grinned that grin he wore when he wanted to get out of trouble, and waved.

Jesse’s arm was trapped and his attempt at waving ended up in the whole sorry pile just wiggling sadly. Kix sighed. “Whatever happened, I don’t need to know.

Jyuugo frowned a bit, perplexed.  “Doesn’t it get in the way?” He gestured. “It just seems… like a lot.”  Uno shook his head, the wave of his hair glinting under the lights. He turned, and dumped a pile of it in Jyuugo’s lap. “It’s really not so bad! See, it’s soft.”  Jyuugo ran a cautious hand through it, and it really was that soft. *~*TEXT*~*

Looking at his Other was like looking in a mirror, and seeing himself as he wanted to be: taller, more confident, with better hair. But that face was just a copy of Yuugi’s own, for the most part.

Please and I beg you, please call me whenever you need me and I’ll be back in a heartbeat.” Jackson said softly by the door. The door closed softly behind him and that was all it took.  All it took for him to let it out. His sobs filled the apartment along with his whimpers and quiet mumblings of ‘I love you’. Scratches were all over the top of his arms and he had bruises forming on his hands from slamming them on the wall. Little did he know, that on the other side of the door, was Jackson.

He was holding a bundle of flowers in his hand. What they meant he didn't know what they meant, and frankly didn't care. His hair blazed red, like a tower of flame. Bowyer eventually came across a figure sitting against a tree, neon eraser pink hair against a highlighter green sweater. And so, Dupli raised a hand to greet him. "Nya! Arrive, I have! Flowers for you, I have brought!" The bow yelled, his grin stretched out ear to ear. He managed to restrain his excitement to see his love, sitting down next to them. Dupli rested their head on Bowyer, body heat rising up to their face as they smiled. "T-Thank you, Bowyer...!" Bowyer's heart skipped a beat. "Nya! No problem, it is!" *~*TEXT*~*

Dean stead in front  of the mirror, taking in the small wrinkles. After a few deaths and apocalypses he certainly earned them. And contrary to Sammy he did not have any gray hair yet, a fact that amused him immensely. A few minor scars but not anything that would either scare away civilians or the ladies.  Dean ignored the distracting sounds of Michael in his mind and reminded himself that he could do what was necessary.  The big 4-0. Not bad. Not bad at all. *~*TEXT*~*

They're still a reddish color, and the bandage on his hand sometimes shifts uncomfortably against the wound on his palm.  "Parents?" I murdered him myself.   The officer glances at him and then back down to his report. "Do you want to make a phonecall?"  He shakes his head.  What need is there? He already saw him behind bars, lollipop in hand.   Nobody left to call. *~*TEXT*~*

Trust me, hyung."  Seokjin cocks an eyebrow at him, his gaze questioning, but lets the matter go. As the older man resumes their walk, Namjoon looks back to the graffiti one last time.   *~*TEXT*~*

He sighs as the aching in his muscles finally begins to ease, then breathes in deeply, the sweet smell making his head spin. “It’s supposed to ease muscle pain and stress and make you feel refreshed.” Marvin smiles, gently cleaning a spot of dried blood from Jackie’s face. “How’d I do?” “Fuckin’ …  super ,” Jackie grins. The water sloshes nearly out of the tub as he scoots forward for a kiss, and Marvin giggles as he pulls him in closer. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Out of all the things on Earth, all the weird foods and different activities that he could've gotten invested in, who knew the biggest one would be video games.  His fingers kept mashing the buttons on the controller, eyes focused on the screen as once again one of the NPCs passed him.  If you paid attention you could hear a faint growl coming from his throat.  Suppressing a laugh, you decided to approach the space prince. As amusing as his struggling was, you felt like you had to give him a hand.  “Do you need help?” You asked, sitting beside him on the couch. Lotor didn't turn to look at you, too focused on his game to shift his attention.  Once again, the noise of losing a race rang through the room, and you couldn't suppress a giggle at it. Lotor might've been an emperor, but it seemed like he wasn't that good at Mario Kart.  “This game is stupid.” He mumbled, setting down the controller and getting up, walking out of the room.  With the alien no longer in the room, you laughed. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“3, 2, 1!” Sidney rose up onto his tiptoes, the alcohol removing his inhibitions as he pressed a fleeting kiss against the corner of Geno’s mouth. The fireworks being set up behind him, were nothing compared to the fireworks that ignited inside as soon as his lips touched Geno’s. Dropping back onto the heels of his feet, Sidney opened his eyes and looked up into the Russian’s face. The sight that greeted him left his heart pummelling down to the floor.    Geno stared down at him with a shocked expression, and immediately Sidney regretted his actions. There was nothing he could do to take the moment back, and now it was going to be his fault if it ruined the team’s chemistry. The kiss was so obviously different to the ones that Flower was dishing out like candy. This one was filled with meaning, and feelings.   “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Sidney stammered, his heart pounding and tears threatening to spill down his face. He felt so stupid and humiliated with himself. Pushing his way through the crowds, Sidney ran back inside the now empty house. He ran towards the front door, pulling it open, he kept running. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Casey looks at Kevin with a jaunty smile. She turns on the stereo, she puts on some music and she comes back to him, but she approaches him with caution as if she doesn't really want to scare him in any way. "Would you like to dance with me?" she asks him, "please" she grabs his hands by dancing awkwardly together until she does a pirouette on herself. Kevin and Casey's laughs echo in their home. "Hold me" Casey whispers softly to Kevin, then she leads him by guiding his hands on her hips. She puts her head against his chest. It's like being in a dream. Their scars don't hurt anymore.

*~*TEXT*~*The mission had gone sideways from the moment he and Tony had touched down. The Hydra base they’d come to investigate was supposed to be abandoned. It was a cut and dry data retrieval mission, Tony just seeing what he could get off their computers. Steve had only tagged along because he had nothing better to do.  Instead, they’d been met by an ambush. Their coms had been scrambled and Tony’s suit taken out with what Steve was pretty sure had been an anti-aircraft missile. Steve had grabbed his unresponsive teammate and dragged him as far out as he could, but it wasn’t far enough. Hydra had still caught up with them before Steve could get them back to the quinjet.  “Move aside, Captain,” the lightly-accented voice instructed with smug glee. “It’s over.”  Steve all but snarled at the man, not moving from his place in front of Tony’s crumpled form. This bastard could fuck off right to hell.  “Why don’t you make me?”  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It's not a very noticeable place, Thousands of places are just like this; A street full of non-discrete houses With homes full of non-discrete people.  People from all walks of life settle down here, All with stories to tell, some of them just beginning. But it matters not to me, I do not know them well. Our houses so close together yet so far apart, Walls of brick and business between us. We have no time for neighbors.  Only the changing leaves show a passing of time. So caught up in our never-changing lives. I do not blame them, I am the same.  The best way to describe my home is: ordinary. Like me, with billions of others like me. But it is what it is, It's home. *~*TEXT*~*

Usually he thought nothing of it, but he watched as the silhouetted reflection mimic’d every move he’d make.  He jumped, it jumped. Spin around, an in-sync copy. There was no way escaping your shadow. As long as light shined, it would hide behind you. But that also meant--  “Jongup-hyung!” Junhong called.  “What took you so long?” Yoonsun asked.  “I was dancing with my shadow.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Just some assorted short pieces and drabbles. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Bertie stared agape at his valet, who'd gone distinctly pink around the ear and cheek region, before said valet biffed off in the direction of the kitchen, presumably to lick his wounded pride. The last of the Woosters simply couldn't believe what his own eyes and ears had told him-that the reason why Jeeves seemed to make himself scarce when crooning was called for, was because the man quite simply, could not carry a tune in a bucket, nor even a wheelbarrow. He couldn't keep a pitch if he had a team of groundskeepers. Quite simply, the velvety voice that was apt to make one go gooey around the middle when speaking could not sing. It took a full minute before Bertie could pick his jaw up from the floor, and another to realize that perhaps apologies should be in order-after all, he'd cajoled Jeeves into singing along with him, despite numerous protests. Looking forlornly at the paisley print tie around his neck, he removed it with some sadness, deciding that it was the least he could do. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Ai still has a phobia of storms. Fortunately, she has a friend by her side. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*When the furious sky cheered, the dark-haired girl shrank even more in the corner of the room, shrieking trembling, feeling her body strongly restless and a sorrow in her hypothetical heart. She was feeling bad. She felt bad for not being able to overcome her fear and go to rehearse with others even when they discovered they couldn't hurt them.  And falling prey to her panic, he didn't hear the door open slowly, followed by the sound of steps that apparently wanted to go unnoticed. She was scared, nervous, and that feeling increased when someone hugged her with clinging.  "Don't worry, everything's fine." Saki's naturally aggressive voice sounded gentle and anguished, surprising Ai who let out a few tears. In turn, her fingers were tangled between her hairs, making her almost assure that it was someone else; but she remembered that the biker was the only one who knew the cause of her death. “Don't you want to accompany us?” In response, she denied forcefully. “It's okay, I'll be with you. The girls will be fine without us...”    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*When there's snow, I come out of my den, high up in the mountains. A blizzard again. Perfect. No one would see me.  Up I fly. Up and up and up. Until I pass the clouds and burst through their icy layer. It is cold up here too, but I thrive in the extreme temperature of the snow called mountains. Such a small change wouldn't harm me.  Deciding to see the world below, I dip through the clouds, watching snow fade into the grass, and then the forests in the valleys.   And as I pass over this world, I become just a dragon in the sky. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*For years after she’d left Bletchley, Millie’s dreams were punctuated by the sound of the machines, keys punching out the Hollerith cards that held the messages she and Susan, Lucy and Jean decrypted. Two million cards a week, the official histories said. No key-punched cards recorded the other messages: the ones never encrypted in the first place, hidden in plain sight. Millie had come close to telling Susan how she felt before she left, but the words remained unspoken. One day, perhaps, some historian would write about that world of women, what the war gave and what it took away. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*In the winter My window freezes The one in the highest part of my room  Where my curtains don’t reach Far above my bed.   I do not fear the cold  Instead I mourn the loss of my lovers face  If I peel back the velvet Early into the winter morning  There is a chance I will see her.   Usually I fall asleep  Lost among endless pages  Intertwined with my blankets  And poked by my pencils  Missing her lovely gaze.   But not tonight  After this years first snow fall I will wait with the sheets of ice That snuck into my room To see her dressed in red And kiss her goodnight. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*                      Steven's other half, his light that had left his body, stared blankly at its host. Not saying a word; it picked the now  completely  human child into its arms. It's expression changed there, now it was no longer blank and unfeeling. It was full of sorrow, crying like he was. Steven's sorrow turned into joy-- hope for the future --as his arms wrapped around its neck. The sorrowful light looked confused at the boy's laughter, but it soon starting laughing itself, there was no sadness or worry there. There was only happiness. The boy who questioned his identity for the last fourteen years finally felt free. Because he was him. There was no  her  to be found. The light that shined for his mother once understood. Its host was now... will always be... at peace. With himself, with the mother who'd birthed him. Two beings became one again; the simple half-gem child named Steven Universe. Tears that fell afterwards, they still were only out of joy. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*But the others don’t know this demon, not like Ruby does.  Written for Reunion in my  @trope_bingo card.   Written for #7 in the  Janelle Monáe Lyrics Prompt Table.  *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The nightmare begins with a scream. An inhuman, unholy noise that sends fear rippling over Ruby’s skin. She has a moment to process the oncoming storm, the tornado churning into a frenzy before her eyes; she’s given only a few seconds to watch the lights flash black and white before recognition washes over her in a cold wave.  Ruby shivers. Her arms and legs are covered in goose-flesh. Her companions stand beside her, riotous and righteous, Liv twisting a lock of pink hair in her hand, Sarah eagerly rising up and down on the balls of her feet.  Still, they remain at her side. Unwavering, unflinching.  As Nikki steps into the light, Ruby feels her allies shift, unsure whether to tense up or relax. Oh, they’ve seen  this one  around. They’re used to facing devils they know. But they don’t know this demon, not like Ruby does.  Nikki bolts to the ring, cackling all the while, shaking the ropes and darting from one corner to the other. She chooses a spot, crouches; she stares wildly, her relentless, unnaturally-wide eyes fixing onto her target.  “Hello, Ruby,” she mouths, grinning. “Remember me?” *~*TEXT*~*

So what’s wrong with adding one more?”  With wet, blurring vision, Himchan simply nodded. “I guess it’s fine then.” *~*TEXT*~*

There was nothing wrong with being punctual. Nothing!  He hunkered down to a proper sulk, glaring at his tea cup as if the power of his glare would fill it.  "Something wrong, Archimedes?" Merlin asked as he turned to his lifelong companion.  "It's tea time," Archie said, prodding at the tea cup.  "Ah," Merlin said with a smile before it turned to a frown. "Impudent piece of crockery," he said with a wearied sigh. Of course that sugar pot would be acting up again. "Now see here, sugar bowl, you're getting rough. That poor old tea set is cracked enough."  Archie just gave him his best flattest look as if to question his Wizard's sanity. "You aren't going to start that routine when we move to the castle proper.. are you?"  Merlin merely smiled. "Higitus figitus zumbabazing.."  "Oh no," Archie groaned. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*If anyone walked by the cottage at that moment, the humming of a happy couple would fill their ears. Clattering of pots and pans fills the air in the kitchen, along with soft giggling. The apprentice stands at the small counter, a knife in hand, slicing freshly washed vegetables. The other residents of the cottage sit at the table behind them, one humming childhood songs and the other receiving soft pets. Soon sizzling joins the soft notes, heavy spices joining the light musical tones in the air. Skittering and silence follow, along with a small cat winding around their ankles.  The apprentice glances behind them at the sudden absence of music, only to find her gazing at them with an unidentifiable emotion in her eyes. They almost scold her for standing from her spot, having told her to relax, but say nothing as she moves behind them, wrapping her arms around their waist. They lean into her touch, keeping an eye on the food in the pan. The heat from the pan warms their fingers in the setting autumn sun, and as they stand in the the arms of their love, they know this is exactly how it should be. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*A poem from The Chevalier's POV to his beloved Philippe. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*He may be the sun, my dear, but you are the star, Present on a canvas of darkest night, twinkling from afar. He may be the King, my love, with powers so divine, But you are the warrior strong and true, and oh how bright you shine...  He may be the chosen one, elevated above, But you are the one the people choose, the one that I so love. He may be the gold, my prince, the richest of them all, But I am richer, for you are silver, I’ll never let you fall...  He may be the King of the pack, diamonds at his touch, I am the joker of the deck, but you’re the ace, so much. He may be the focus of a portrait- an obedient master’s art, But you’re the meaning behind it all, the depth, the soul, the heart...  He may be the sun, my dear, but you are the brightest moon, Whilst daytime fades, your time begins, that time will be here soon. He may be the centre, my sweet, of all of space and time, He may be the universe, but you’ll forever be the centre of mine. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Asuka, be a good boy for papa. While I’m away.” Asuka mom told him placing a kiss on his forehead before walking out the door.  “Papa,” Asuka called out in search of his father who was currently working in his study. Knocking on the door he did not receive an answer. Opening the door he looked inside to see his father was sitting at his desk typing away at his laptop.  “Papa,”Asuka called out to his father once more finally gaining his attention.  “What is it, Asuka.” His father said getting up from his seat and lifting his son in his arms.  “Momma left,” Asuka said.  “Well, then it just you and me then,” Hiromi said hugging his son. “How about we bake some cookies?”  “Yes, cookies.” Asuka cheered.  Hiromi laughed and carried Asuka into the kitchen.  “Papa, will be together forever?” Asuka asked.  “Of course. I love you to the moon and back.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Even though he should be used to it, Junhong always feels a twinge of worry when Yongguk withdraws himself to work on projects alone. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Yongguk was alone in his room, withdrawn as he worked on his various projects. This wasn’t really unusual and most of the others had gotten used to it--except Junhong.  He stood outside the door, tempted to knock. It’s been several days now. Does Yongguk really like being alone that much? Hopefully it was fun, at least.  Junhong gently placed his hand on the door, wearing a lonely expression. “I miss you, hyung.”  Slowly, he walked away, far enough distance to miss the doorknob turning. Yongguk peaked his head outside to see Junhong briefly disappear from sight.   And then he smiled. *~*TEXT*~*

She turns and reaches for the sleeve of cookies Xavier keeps above the fridge, and Scott doesn't think to ask her how she knew they were there.   “It's just, uhm, some good strategies for our battle tactics,” he says, flushing.   Jean shrugs and eats a cookie. “It's Slim, right?”  “Uh… Scott, actually,” he says, fidgeting with his glasses, feeling bad for having to correct her.   “Oh,” Jean says. “Why do they call you Slim?”  He shrugs. “It's punchier than calling me Malnourished Summers.”  He startles a laugh out of her, and it's so wheezy and obnoxious and adorable, and he wants to make her laugh like that all the time. *~*TEXT*~*

Raven can tell from the spaced-out tone of her voice that she's  seeing  it right now, watching events play out. “And— oh!” She bursts out laughing.   “What? What is it?”  “You'll be there.”  Mystique stares. “Why would I be at Kitty Pryde's wedding?”  “You're going to want to be there,” Irene says evasively, returning to her neglected cereal. “Just trust me.”  “You'll be there too, right?”  “No, I'll be dead by then.”  She always says it like that, so casual and dismissive, and no matter how many times she hears it Raven still gets twisted up about it. “I hate it when you say things like that.”  “Death is just a part of life, my dear,” Irene tells her. “Could you please pour me another cup of coffee?” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*No reflection, no surcease *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The Oath had become a thing present in the world. A thing with claws and teeth. No light reflected from its obdurate form, and its unyielding exigencies allowed of no reflection from those prisoned in its coils, its pitiless and ill-considered clauses. It lurked, ominous, not unlike a spider in the corner of the eye; weblike caught at breath and hand and heart, tangling thought, snarling hair and sinew to red and sticky thread; a tapestry of dread, of doom, of woe. Seven it had snared already: it hungered for the eighth, the last living voice that might unmake it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Loki isn’t feeling to well, and you take it into your hands to fix that. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Loki doesn’t sleep too much. Even when he does, it seems restless, like he just can’t let go of his latent fear. Sometimes you catch him staring off at nothing, dark eye circles aging his face, a forlorn look on his face. “Maybe he’s homesick?” You wonder. “Or maybe he’s just tired right now.”  “Loki?”  “Yes, Love?” “Are you ok?” He sighs, and offers you a soft smile. “Just tired, promise.” You frown. That’s not a real answer. Instead of pushing the issue, though, you elect to grab his hand and walk away, pulling him with you. He seems amused, and doesn’t object. You push him onto the couch and tell him to stay. He humors you and does. You leave for a moment, only to return with a soft pillow.  “It’s silk, your royal dorkness. It should be comfy enough for you to sleep.” As you start to walk away, slender fingers interlock with yours, and suddenly you’re pulled down with him. You decide not to question the occurrence, instead tucking your head under his chin and sighing.  “Love?” “Hmm?” “Thank you.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Loki thinks about love and what he’s feeling. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*It didn’t start out like this. He hadn’t even given you a second thought at first. But now? Now you consumed his every thought. He wonders why you stuck around, why you bothered trying to be nice to him. You weren’t going to gain anything from it, and he certainly didn’t return the favor. But you persisted. Every day, smiling and trying to be kind. You INSISTED on helping him, and he was only complying somewhat for the sake of getting it to stop. At least, that’s how it was at first. He got used to it, eventually. The smiling, the cheerful acceptance, the invitations, the offers of food, of friendship. He will admit, he was trying to run you away in the beginning. He thought he didn’t want your kindness. Not anymore. The days you aren’t around kill him. You’re still here with him, and he clings to that fact like a lifeline. Nothing else on this planet matters, he decides. Nothing at all. Just you. It was always just going to be you. *~*TEXT*~*

All for you!” “Gee, thanks, son,” the Sheriff groused. “Thought I’d raised you to put others before yourself, especially loved ones.” “You did, Dad.

*~*TEXT*~*Words did not do justice to the beauty that was his love. Dean couldn’t describe it, didn’t want to describe it, but whenever he locked his gaze on those stormy blue eyes, he couldn’t bear to look away. Whenever he felt the ghost of a soft touch, he couldn’t help but lean into it. Whenever he heard that deep, gravelly voice, he couldn’t help but turn, desperate almost. Perhaps it had something to do with losing him before, yearning not to lose him a second time. Celestial seemed a fitting description, he thought, for something so different, yet so beautiful.    *~*TEXT*~*

Silence followed and Yoongi squinted his eyes, his teeth grinding, before bellowing “It’s pink!”  The maknae looked slightly amused for a moment  “Yes! And It is also Jinnie-hyung’s shirt. ” Kookie replied simply. An embarrassed blush appeared on Yoongi’s cheeks before he threw the garment at the youngest with a “Next time put it on the right bed if you don’t want to get in trouble.” the eldest mumbled in a huff making the maknae chuckled as he answered “Maybe next time you should do your own laundry…” the only answer Jungkook got was a groan of annoyance and the banging of a bedroom door, which made him laugh even more. *~*TEXT*~*

Kakyoin blushes and smiles at his friend, “Y-yes…. Thank you.” “Okay.” Jotaro says, turning to leave, “Good. I’m off, then.” As his friend begins to walk away, Kakyoin realizes something. “W-wait!” he shouts after the retreating Jotaro.  “Hm?” Jotaro questions, turning back to see why Kakyoin called for him to wait. Kakyoin’s blush deepens as he stutters, “I-I….. I lvove you...”  Jotaro stares at his friend wordlessly, a blush creeping across his cheeks before responding, “I love you too…” Kakyoin gasps, shocked at Jotaro’s response. “R-really?” He asks, feeling like it’s too good to be true. “Yes…” Jotaro replies. Kakyoin is speechless, and stares open-mouthed at Jotaro for a moment, before jumping on him. (And you can guess what happened next…) *~*TEXT*~*

Arnold sat quietly, unsure of what to say. "You can't even answer me, Can you?" , "I-I'm sorry" Arnold replied. Gordon gently lasted down the knife and turned to Arnold, "Do not apologize for something youre not sorry for", "Gordon, You know I love you" shouted Arnold. "You may love me, Arnold, but that didn't stop you from screwing Donald" Gordon retaliated. Arnold took a step towards Gordon, "Get out" whispered Gordon, "were done". Arnold was stunned as he walked out the door and made his way to the chopper. Who knew that one mistake could ruin everything, if only Arnold could have resisted Donald's hay like hair and Cheeto orange skin. Arnold regrets everything about that night, if only he could turn back time. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Let me give you a piece of advice,” Bai Yu whispers conspiratorially. “Choose one for your fans once in a while.”  “What? Populistic drivel?”  “I didn’t say you should compromise on quality. But people deserve to see you happy sometimes.”  Zhu Yilong’s eyes narrow.  “Don’t say you’re worried about having to kiss a woman.”  Zhu Yilong’s slight wince is answer enough.   Bai Yu grins, “If you ever get over 82 kisses, you can come talk to me again.”  He pulls Zhu Yilong close and kisses him deeply, leaving no room for doubt who gets to kiss Zhu Yilong most often. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Mac and Stella have a quiet moment in the locker room. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*She stood there when he closed the door of his locker. "You're going home early", she observed. "Yeah." She thought he was going to leave, but he just sat down on the bench, his back to her, staring at his hands. She opened her locker. Neither said anything for some time. She was done and sat down next to him. He was still not looking up. "I miss her." A small tremble in his voice, like a stone rippling the water, surface normally a mirror. A distorted image; reflection of his emotions. "I know." Hers calming, like the first ray of sunlight on a spring morning. She remembered. "It's her birthday." "Yes." A single tear on his cheek, glistening proof of his grief. A warm hand moved to his shoulder, pulled him into an embrace as he wept quietly. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Sam's impressive knowledge is a real turn on *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*You had always had a fascination with ancient mythos. Studying Greek and Roman and Nordic mythology and culture, reading everything you could get your hands on, even the Percy Jackson series’. In your former life, you were considered a near expert, your friends always coming to you with questions or asking about references.  Sam, however, put you to shame. His brain was like a lore sponge. He knew everything about things you didn’t even know existed. Their patterns of behavior, their methods, their eating habits, their mating rituals, and most importantly how to kill them.   His mental capacity for lore and everything to do with the occult was astonishing, admirable, and sexy as hell. You never imagined yourself to be sapiosexual until you met Sam Winchester. After that, it had been a real effort to keep yourself from soaking your panties every time he went over the facts of a case, or rattling off information on what you were hunting and what patterns could be followed to find them. But that just made wrapping up a case all the more fun, for both of you. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Diversity?  What is that?” Thor asked Banner.  “Well, it’s being inclusive of all different races, religions and sexes,” Banner explained. “It means acknowledging them all and providing equal opportunity to each.”  “I still don’t understand,” Thor said.  “What is it that is still confusing you?”  Banner knew that sometimes Thor could be a bit thick, but this was an easy one.  “We had the same religion on Asgard and sexes were equal as well.  We do what our talents call us to do.  But I don’t get the race part.  You’re all one race here on Earth – the human race.” *~*TEXT*~*

"My book shop is in Diagon," Hermione said from the depths of the window display. "And your shop is connected to mine through that door." She gestured absently toward the back of the shop. "Logically, that means your shop is in also in Diagon." "Lies. I never agreed to this." She ignored him. "And you are my boyfriend and therefore you are participating. I picked out that costume specifically for you. It's perfect. Pale, spends most of the time in a dark room, strange clouds of smoke drifting through doorways."  "That is ... accurate. But beside the point." "Malfoy." Hermione raised her head over a stack of books, her glittery wings fluttering as she moved. "Put it--  oh ." Draco loomed out of the dark.  She couldn't take her eyes off the slim, pointed fangs exposed by his wicked smile. "That, um. That is."  "Your idea." She shivered in delight. "Yes. And it was a great one."  She tipped her head back and stroked her throat. He pulled her into the shadows. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*What  is  the point of a haunted house? *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*"If you wanted to explore a haunted house, I can think of a dozen that would suit." Draco stuffed his hands in his pockets. The flickering torches around the decorated courtyard did nothing for warmth. "All manner of ghosts. Bonus, creaky floors and moaning in the attics. Come to think of it, we went to school in a haunted house." Hermione pushed her woolen hat up her forehead and blew on her fingers. "That's not the point. Muggles don't do this because they want to see ghosts. For one thing, to most Muggles, ghosts are purely imaginary."  They shuffled closer to the hooded figure guarding the narrow entry. Draco shook his head. "Then what exactly is the point?" Twin screams came from the upper floor of the house, followed by a lightning flash. The torches went out simultaneously, plunging the courtyard into blackness. Screams and shouts echoed off the stone walls. Hermione shuddered and whipped around to bury her face in the thick folds of Draco's scarf.  He blinked in surprise, then noted several other couples in similar poses. "Oh," he said with a wicked grin. He slipped both arms around her and held her close. "Now I get it." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*I wish it was easier to kiss you on the mouth,  “Rumlow?”  She lifts her chin slightly, fixes a steely-eyed gaze on him. The silence is all the confirmation he needs.  “Is he just a warm body, Maria? Is that it?”  She wants to tell him that she doesn’t have to explain any of this to him. She’s said enough, of what could be said aloud to him, anyway. But the way he’s looking at her – that sombre earnest in his eyes – she feels yet again the damning pull to justify her actions; not to allay anything on her part, but an attempt to soothe the worry lines in his open face.  “We’re just friends, Steve.”  The ambiguity in her words lay quietly between the two, but the familiarity stands resoundingly.  She means it as a salve, she hopes he doesn’t take it as a salvo.  He nods slowly, straightens up and turns towards the door.  “Be careful, Maria.”  He wishes it were him. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*This was my first time writing a drabble in a long time - I'd forgotten how quickly 100 words go by! This takes place in the universe of my Weki Meki longfic "I Don't Like Your Girlfriend," between chapters 46 and 47. This was originally written for the femslashficlets community at Dreamwidth, challenge #193, "favorite." *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Lucy knew she wasn't supposed to have favorites among her girlfriends.  That didn't change the fact that Sei was her favorite.  She and Sei had been together since Weki Meki's debut.  The long bus rides to promotions for "I Don't Like Your Girlfriend" had provided them with ample time for hushed conversations and furtive kisses.  Except for a couple of weeks, they'd been together ever since.   Yes, Sei was definitely her favorite.  That's why she was halfway across Seoul, braving the winter weather to go to a small tea shop that carried tea from a brand from Singapore.  Sei's favorite. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Harold had been warned about fortune hunters. He had seen what had happened with Cora and, though Robert treated her like a queen, he had always been worried about the motives of his prospective brides. Then he had met sweet, kind, beautiful Madeleine and he found he didn’t worry anymore. When he was with her, he realised that he had found someone truly special. The fact that she didn’t have an eye on his fortune, that she loved him for who he was, despite the substantial age gap, was proof that she was worth all the gold in the world. *~*TEXT*~*

And Kaolu’s silent question of  what Ruki could have been doing to ruin his work like that  was answered with the sight of his dark-smeared sheepish smile.            Kaolu shook his head with a defeated smile as he picked a flacon out of his make-up case. “Come in, you two. But make sure you’re finished with your business, I’m not doing Ruki’s lipstick a third time.”            The two musicians looked at each other and their dark lips stretched into knowing smiles.            “We’ll come back a little later, actually,” Ruki chuckled before disappearing to run after his guitarist. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Their love is intense, lips burning fire against one another as they kiss, an inferno blazing in their veins. They collided like stars, sparks bursting forth, but their hands were gentle, careful, hesitant. They didn’t want to hurt the other anymore than they knew they’d been hurt before.  “Sam,” Gabe gasped, Sam yanking the sweater off his lover.  “It’s okay, we can stop if you want to.”  “No, I just… are you… you sure about this?”  Sam frowned at how small and scared the other man’s voice was. He’d never known Gabe to be so unsure of himself, so unconfident. But so much had changed in the last decade, and it was showing on the lines on his now human face. “Gabriel, I’m never sure about anything.” His face fell at Sam’s words, but the hunter wasn’t done. “But I am sure about you.”  A broad smile broke out on his face, Gabriel tugging Sam down to kiss him fully on the mouth again, the hunter lifting him up by the thighs to brace against the wall. No one else was awake, and no one would dare open Sam’s door without knocking anyways. They had time *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*"Hi! This is for the Naraku ask.

(This probably messes up the entire story of Inuyasha)" *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*There was no way to know at the time what the result of your actions would be. You just did what you had to do, what anyone would have done, what was right. You had found the man on the point of death, and you intervened, saving his life, and nursing him back to health.      If you had known what he would go on to do, the things he would cause to happen, not just to you, but to others would you have left him there to die?      It’s what he asks you now, as he pins you between him in the wall, his demonic energy suffocating. Even if you wanted to escape him you couldn’t, you’re not strong enough, and he knows it.      “No…”  It’s not something you like to admit. A world of suffering, a scourge of demons upon the earth, all things you could have prevented, all things you wouldn’t prevent because you are weak.      And Naraku smirks, knowing he’s won.  *~*TEXT*~*

He held on for a long moment, then pulled back.  “You’re looking well.” “I’m feeling well, too,” she said.  “I miss you, and everybody back home, but this is the right thing to do.” “I’m glad,” said Ducky.  “I’m also glad you were able to arrange your flight to meet up with me.” “I wouldn’t miss it,” Abby told him.  “So, how is everyone…?” THE END *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"Dammit Cas," Dean growled, grabbing his tie and yanking him to his body, and kissing him - gentle but ferociously. One hand gripped his tie, and the other hung loose at his side, one of his pearl handled pistols swaying from his fingers. He had known Cas for 8 years now, been staring at him for 7, and had finally given in.  Cas seemed frozen. Well, at least he knew how Dean felt now.    Seeming to come out of his initial shock, Cas suddenly came to life, one hand tangling in Dean's hair as he pushed him backwards. Dean let himself be pushed back in surprise, not expecting the rush of dominance coming from the other man. The gun clattered to the floor out of his relaxed fingers as his back hit one of the wooden supports of the building's basement they were in. His arm reached under the trench coat and looped tight around the angel's waist.    "Cas," Dean's voice whispered through the soft sound of their bodies pressing together, the fabric wrinkling between them. "I love you."    He felt the angel smile underneath his lips, "I love you too, Dean" *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Hinata and Kageyama are resting on a bench after volleyball practice, exhausted. When, suddenly, Hinata's arms are around Kageyama. "Kageyama..." he calls out weakly, exhaustion dripping from his voice. Kageyama's cheeks feel warm, and it quickly spreads to his ears and neck. But no other words follow. "W-what...?" he mumbles. Is Hinata... hugging him? Hesitantly, Kageyama decides to return the hug, resting one arm on Hinata's back. And then he freezes when he speaks again. "Water..." As soon as that word comes out of Hinata's mouth, Kageyama realises what is happening. There's a water bottle right next to Kageyama on the bench they're sharing, and Hinata was trying to reach it without even even bothering to avoid the very obvious obstacle in his way. But now it didn't seem like he cared much. He was already sound asleep. Kageyama sighed. "Dumbass..." But his arm didn't leave Hinata's back.   *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Poem based on Spring Awakening. I needed to vent, so I thought I'd write something about the hope of the future, which is a key theme from the show. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The preachers wearing gilded cloaks of lead  Eschew the warning “hypocrites shall die.”  The somber intonations of the dead  Are but their dogma’s victims’ wounded cry,  “And now our bodies are the guilty ones.”  And yet the scourge of scarlet rests with them  Who lie to daughters, enby kids, and sons,  And from whom bigotry and hatred stem.  But we, the youth, the hope of humankind,  Supplant the old, entrenched in their old wrongs  When one knows how to trust one’s own true mind,  Then all shall know the wonder of our songs.  As surely as the winter turns to spring,  The Song of Purple Summer we will sing. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Cosima calls her. At least she used to, she'd call once a day every day, checking she was alright. Knowing she wasn't, so just checking she was alive at least.  But Alison, couldn't find it in her to call back. She felt guilty but no matter how hard she tried she couldn't bring herself to call her.  Her and Cosima had been close before. They used to get high together, get drunk. Laugh together, dance together, they were like sisters. But now... Alison couldn't stand to be near her. To let herself be close to someone who reminded her so strongly of Beth. She couldn't bring herself to get close to any of her clones, they all reminded her to much of Beth. She couldn't get near anyone, but Felix was different.  She'd not known Felix from before. He'd no idea who Beth was and then he had known, he would sit their with her. Both of them getting drunk. Felix would hug her close. He'd try to help her. But Alison was unreachable. Untouchable, the scars Alison bore on the inside. The hurt she harboured. Alison was completely alone. Stuck in a dome which was damn near impenetrable. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Marceline wasn’t fond of pink. It was bright and cheery and didn’t taste as good as red. She liked black and grey and red but never pink.  When she met Bonnibel, she didn’t like her either. She was stuffy and royal and too smart for her own good.   Still, Marceline got a kick out of annoying her.  But then annoying her turned to hanging out with her turned to liking her turned to loving her turned to hating her turned to… loving her again.   So Marceline is fond of pink. The pink of sticky hair her cold fingers loved to play with. The pink of pale skin that smelled sweeter than the most delicious red cherries. The pink of dresses thrown onto Marceline’s bedroom floor in a hurry. The pink of warmth that Marceline’s vampiric heart hadn’t felt in so, so long.   There was no harm in strawberry ice cream making its way into her fridge. She didn’t mind the pink flats and heels that always sat in the entryway. It was fine that pink was slowly taking over half of her closet.   Yes, Marceline loved pink but she would never admit it to Bonnibel. She loved Bonnibel more anyway. *~*TEXT*~*

Lowe leaned to look and yeah, the design was solid, numbers looked good, and all the parts needed were things they already had. That would go a long way into making Red Frame a little bit better than it already was.  And that there was going to be a next time. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Deep down, Sephiroth sometimes wondered what his life would be like if things had been different. If he hadn't been carefully guided into his current role, if he'd somehow had a bit more choice, if somehow...  He'd picked up so many odd little skills along the way, from watching, from assisting, from needing to make do in the field...  He'd read textbooks, manuals, and notes left behind, half from genuine interest and half because it did make everything easier...  But he never had any choice, could he? Not considering what he'd just found.  He knew what he needed to do. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Long live the day Modern poets say, When poems stopped needing to rhyme.   There’s no reason, you see, For poems to be Kept in some perfect time.   The neurotic poet, of course,  Knows rhymes help to enforce That you’re reading a poem at all,   But the truth of it is,  In the poetry biz, That detail is really quite small.   A poem on page Should set the stage To the reader with its verse and flow;   Still there are some  Who have gone quite numb And see rhymeless poems as foe.   Those poets will gripe And their pages they’ll wipe Until their hair has gone gray.   And to them I just say, Have a good day, And I’ll end my last stanza with orange.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The start of a collection of PMMM ficlets. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~* Coffeeshop AU   Madoka bit her lip as she watched Homura drain her sixteenth coffee of the day, wishing she hadn’t let her talk her into taking so many extra shifts, even if they did need some way of keeping their hands busy and their minds occupied until the funeral.  When the phone rang, Homura answered it, then rushed over and dragged her down to the shop basement, saying something about a storm warning. Madoka shivered while the building creaked and groaned above them, grateful for the warmth of her friend’s embrace; when the lights cut out and the ground churned beneath them, she wondered whether she was dreaming the pain, just as she’d dreamed of death before, and only grew more certain of it as Homura was crushed against her, whispering apologies and impossible promises. *~*TEXT*~*

It wouldn't have been so difficult and traumatic, he just had to let go of himself and catch up to Henry in a dream. A dream where they could finally find each other.   During the expedition there have been a few caresses and fleeting kisses, such as the intimacy... because there were discretion and duty before their love! But for what?   If only he had known that his beloved would have died suffering because of lead poisoning he would have remained beside him unstintingly not only during his last moments... if only he had known that all the meat cans he kept to give them to the younger one would have been the cause of his death John would have gladly eaten them, him, so old and so useless in that expedition.

*~*TEXT*~*She hears the whispers in every town and city that their group visits; most are about the unique traveling group that they make, but most of them are about her as a Mage. They call her an apostate mage, and she probably is one, but she doesn't think of herself in that way.  Aerith doubts that most of the little people will even care about what she is when her healing potions are used to soothe their hurts.  A hand lands gently on her shoulders, and she looks up with a smile at Zack, a former member of the Templar Order, as her hands create new potions for the group to use.  "I'm glad that one of my wishes allowed us to meet in this life and become friends, Zack."  "I'm glad for that as well, Aerith," Zack grins lightly. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*After a confusing Valentine's Day and an even more confusing dinner with Italy, Germany isn't sure what to make of things. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Germany rushed back into the safety of his house, locked the door, and collapsed in a chair at the kitchen table, head in his hands. Had he done something wrong? He had followed the book’s proposal instructions perfectly, but Italy’s reaction was all wrong. He had spent hours memorizing that chapter, and it said nothing about  this .  His mind felt broken, but he didn’t try to fix it. Whatever emotions he was repressing would surely cause more damage on the surface than they would buried deep beneath. Yes, Germany’s strategy now would be survival. His strength could outlive the shame.  He clung to that belief until he looked up and saw the vase full of roses from Italy—sweet, infuriating, perfect Italy. Something snapped back into place in his brain, releasing the feelings he was trying so desperately to ignore. The tears started to fall, and they stung like thorns.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Tim might have known about Batman before, but this is the first time he has seen him quite this close. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The belt, dizzying in its understated technological sophistication. A part of Tim feels like the eight years old boy he never really was. The cape, hugging Batman's shoulders as a violent promise. Another part of him is more terrified than he has ever been. A symbol engraved over a human chest. A vow to be both less and more than human. It's Batman. Fear is a rational response. An useful tool. Armored gauntlets, designed to pick locks and strike nerves. Everything but caress. All forms of touch but human touch. But not one to be displayed. Never. White lenses than feel truer than the eyes beyond them. Not uncaring, but pitiless in their care. "The way to deal with your own fear," he had been taught once, "is to pass it on to somebody else." With a flawlessly repressed shudder, Tim turns away from the mirror and walks to the Car. The Cave's walls are the color of ashes and the driving wheel feels like deadwood in his hands, but Batman narrows his white eyes in anticipation of the night, and inside the suit Tim tastes the fear he will share with Gotham tonight. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Batman needs a Robin... and so does Bruce. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The mugger was unconscious over the dirty alley's pavement; the couple he had been threatening was now thanking him profusely. Robin looked to the rooftops above, where Batman was watching everything with near absolute focus. Why had he sent him instead of stopping the mugger himself? Knowing what he knew about Bruce's past, he would have expected this to be a situation Batman would have *had* to handle by himself. Then Tim noticed the shadows cast against a wall by the sole street lamp. A couple's shadow, saved in the nick of time by the shadow of a kid. Instead of joining Batman immediately as indicated by their protocols, he allowed the woman to give him a brief hug that somehow extended into a long one, while the man put a proud hand over his shoulder. He didn't need to look up to know that Bruce was watching them even more intently than before. Tim had always known that Batman needed a Robin. He was beginning to understand what for. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The scary thing about Tim is that he usually takes the most direct approach to solve any given problem. Note that  direct  doesn't mean  sane . *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The boy was shaking so much that he chose to wait in an alley for a few minutes before going back home. The bullets had been so close this time... Robin -Dick- was good, but tonight it had been luck, too. By definition, Tim knew, luck didn't held forever. A flash of light embraced the alley's end, and when Tim could see again there was Batman... no, a man dressed like Batman walking toward him. The man was somewhat shorter than Batman, and his suit seemed different, perhaps even more sophisticated. He squatted effortlessly in front of Tim. "I know what you are thinking, and it's true. It could happen at any moment. Now, in ten years, in twenty. Doing what he does, being who he is, Dick could die at any moment. Unless you are there to protect him." The man took off his cowl. His face was also Tim's own. "I can make you good enough." He cupped his younger self's face. "I can teach you how to be everything he needs." The smile was a lie and a mirror, and Tim was already learning. *~*TEXT*~*

"Zatanna's information was accurate," said Batman.  "I'm glad to hear that, sir. I assume mind swaps can be terrible nuisances."  Batman sat at the computer's main terminal. "Quite. I've already lost too much time dealing with this."  Robin nodded, walking toward the stairs. "Alfred," he said as he passed the old man.  He frowned, looking at him with widening eyes. "Master Bruce...?"  "It doesn't matter," said the boy without slowing his ascent.  Batman kept working silently.  An hour later, Alfred brought down his dinner. *~*TEXT*~*

"Well, I wouldn't quite say that, but I do know a thing or two about wrangling in a wayward kite."    When she smiles, her eyes crinkle at the corners and he could kiss every freckle. "Is that right? Well, would you mind showing me some pointers down at the park, say, around three?"    "It'd be an honor and a privilege." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*To say Arcee enjoyed cuddling her girlfriend would be an understatement. After a long day her favorite thing to do was plop on the couch, wait til Ratchet sat down, and burrow in close to relax. The classic movie channel on TV always provided some nice background noise as they cuddled close, just enjoying a quiet evening. Most of the time she would find herself slipping down until her head was nestled on Ratchet’s lap. It was the coziest place in the world for her and she loved to relax there.  	Ratchet would often just smile down at her, petting her head as she shifted to make sure they were both comfortable as they settled in to watch the movie. It was quiet and enjoyable and let them just check the stress of their day-to-day at the door and enjoy one another’s company. It was, in Arcee’s mind, perfection. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Her entire life Bastila followed the Jedi Code--she believed in its wisdom and the strength of its tutelage, but as she finds herself growing more and more attached to the fallen Jedi Revan, she begins to feel herself and her own strength in the code break at the seams. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Attachment is forbidden.   It makes one blind. It becomes the chains Which traps and binds. When emotions run free and untethered. And passions seize control Everything that is becomes severed. The darkness will begin to call As attachment melts into fear It becomes inevitable--the fall.   Possession is forbidden   The code echoes within my mind A reminder of all that is true and meant to be But it grows softer as I leave it behind And set forth on a new endeavor The presence of one who was lost Is twinned with my soul forever.  Mounting fear rises tall This emotion I was never meant to feel It possesses and seduces me under its thrall.   Love is forbidden.   Yet instead of the dark, there is only kind The one who had fallen is a Jedi more than me Passions rage with compassion, emotions unconfined. Under its soft touch, I tremor It twists and churns within me Undefined emotions bring terror I break the code and feel myself to begin to fall Sudden control wrenched from my hands As my heart begins to crawl.   Everything I am must be hidden.  *~*TEXT*~*

While he, Robin, and Lucina had been looking over a map for the next day, apparently the rest of the camp had been cooking. Chrom had smelled the feast, yes, but he hadn't realized the sheer amount of food that had been prepared. Gods, not a one of them would be remotely willing to walk more than a few feet in the morning. Surely, some of the bounty could have been preserved...  Well, they'd lost their planned day off in the Outrealm to fighting Risen.  Chrom smiled. "Let's eat!" *~*TEXT*~*

True, the last rays of sunlight were vanishing beyond the trees, but night just meant there would be more voices in the air and interesting bits of information to listen for. Andrew didn't have his headset on yet though. That would come after Mwu and Murrue shuffled off to bed. Best to keep their sounds isolated from one another, after all.  There hadn't been anything interesting for awhile. Things were calm, quiet... Too quiet. Every night, Andrew expected something to finally happen.  He had his coffee. They could happen. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Just a conversation between Albus and Severus. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*„Severus, can I?“  „No.“  „Why not, Severus?“  „Therefore.“  “Just for a moment.”  “NO.”  “Five minutes.”  “NO!”  “Just for one lemon drop.”  “NOO!”  “You must feel lonely.”  “I don´t.”   “I know what it´s like. For whole year I couldn´t talk to anybody.”    “I did not notice.”  “Yes, I could talk with someone, but it´s not the same.”  “And what the others?”  “You are closest to me, Severus. You are like my son, they are only friends.”  “Sure, a son! Whoever wants his son to kill him?”  “It was for greater good and you well know that.”  “Sure!”  “So, can I?”  “You won´t leave me alone until I agree, right?”   “Do you have to ask at all? You know me.”  Resigned sigh.  “Just for a minute then.”  “I knew you would agree.”  Albus Dumbledore slowly moved from his portrait into portrait of former Head of Slytherin House, Severus Snape. A similar conversation was led every evening between them and Albus was always able to enforce his own. Severus might have defied himself at first, but he always succumbed.   “Drop, Severus?”  Growl. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Neither one was innocent... *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Hinoka sighed. It had been raining for two days already and according to Shirasagi's diviners, it was probably going to rain for two more. While she was frustrated, however, her pegasus seemed to be faring even worse. Hinoka, at least, hadn't chewed up part of a fancy blanket likely out of sheer boredom.  She couldn't be too mad, though.  "So I thought I might get some practice in anyway," she admitted as she brushed soft, white fur. "Put a hole right in the wall. I don't know who was more angry, Ryoma or Mother Mikoto.  "Now I'm stuck doing things like calligraphy, and origami, even though I'm kind of terrible at both. Sakura likes origami, though, and she doesn't mind how bad some of my folds are..."  She kept brushing and talking, calming herself down a bit and feeling less frustrated overall. This wasn't the open air or diving at straw dummies, but it was something. She was sure her pegasus felt the same, which was a good feeling and the kind of peace they'd both been lacking.  It was probably worth a few days of rain and a hole in the wall...  And Ryoma's horrified yet impressed expression, too. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*   Juno’s fingers clenched around the edge of the desk. “You’re the worst thing that ever happened to me.”  Ramses chuckled, almost cruelly, his fingers idly trailing down Juno’s exposed back. “But I’m the best thing that happened to this city.”  Juno grit his teeth. From the window behind Ramses’ desk Hyperion City sprawled up to the horizon. A sea of blinking lights and fluorescent signs under the stars. Large and ugly and the most precious jewel in the universe.  “And isn’t that worth more, Juno?” Ramses asked, lips grazing the shell of his ear.  Juno didn’t know what to say. He wanted to rant, wanted to yell. Ends didn’t justify means. But the people of Hyperion City, all of them, even the ones in Old Town, had never been better of.   So he just turned his head and covered Ramses in bruising kisses as the old man laughed at him.       *~*TEXT*~*

The hands on him now are a ghost of what he had wanted lifetimes ago, but they are a reminder of what he never got to really feel for himself.  If he had not died then, perhaps he would have gotten to feel it.  But there was no use dwelling on the past. *~*TEXT*~*

That’s what people did, after all, they made choices throughout the day - like choosing not to take drugs. Choosing to occupy one’s mind with other endeavours instead. Choosing to allow a sober companion to follow you around to appease the man who technically owned your house - fine, who did own your house.

Then two eyes opened and blinked; eyes that could cut through the strongest metal and shrivel the grandest tree. Those eyes narrowed, and the Fright felt a chill run through its mind.  'What are you?' it thought, and it felt the answer almost as soon as it thought the question. It moved forward, a little terrified, but still determined.  The eyes narrowed further; those two intelligent, sharp, terrifying eyes. The Fright backed away.  'You shan't pass,' it felt. 'Not alive, at any rate.'  The Fright tried to will the Shadow away. That was not a good idea. He felt his mind lifted, and thrown into the blackness; up, up, up....and he came back down several distances away.  'That was barely scratching the surface,' the Shadow thought, and the Fright shook its heads and ran away, into the darkness behind him.  *~*TEXT*~*

"I'm sorry, Dipper. I'm glad to have you as a brother, I'll always love you bro-bro."   "No-c'mon-Mabel. Don't- we can talk about this. Please." He said through the tears.   The female twin closed her eyes and turned away.  Bill laughed evilly as the Pines family watched Mabel disappear. *~*TEXT*~*

As they were leaving the funeral, the doctor that had took care of him approached.  “A few days before he passed away, he gave me this, with explicit orders to give this to you when...” the doctor couldn’t finish his sentence.  Wordlessly, she took the envelope. And opened it.  A red kerchief fell out. Embroidered with the logo of the Zootopia Junior Rangers.  Her birthday sewn on one corner .  And a note.

*~*TEXT*~*“And what is this?” Esther called out, as Mayer scrapped as much of the mud off his shoes as he could on the mat outside his door. The rain had soaked him through and through. Even his beard was dripping. He handed his umbrella to Esther, who doubled over laughing. The thing had been torn inside out by the wind, and was nearly unrecognizable.  “Am I not going to get any sympathy from my wife?” Mayer teased. He placed his hand on her belly, which was large with child. It was good to see her so merry in her condition, and good to have a few more months of being just the two of them, before they could welcome their little son or daughter into the world.  Esther’s smile softened. “I have no sympathy for foolish men who go out to watch thunderstorms,” she said. “But I do have soup and dry clothes. Now come inside.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Sarah takes a keen interest in the pretty opera singer next door. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*David didn’t even like that racket the birds made first thing in the morning. It was so much worse when rational human beings, who ought to know better, decided that five AM was the time to waltz around the rooftops, being shrill and operatic. For the third day in a row David was torn from his dreams by a loud and triumphant high note. He flopped over in bed to try and block it out, and that’s when he noticed Sarah peering out the window through her lace curtains.  “She always hangs up the laundry at this time,” Sarah breathed.  “I know.”  “She’s beautiful and I have to meet her.” Sarah’s blush was not lost on David, but he chose to ignore it.  “Good idea. Tell her that some of us like to sleep.”  Sarah had no answer for this. She rolled her eyes, and clambered out the window, probably in pursuit of their mysterious singing neighbor.   Now I can get some rest , David told himself, but this resolution didn’t last for long. Within a few minutes curiosity got the best of him, and he took over Sarah’s place at the window, to peer out and watch the scene unfold. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“I could cut it for you,” Mush offered.  Blink bristled. “You saying there’s something wrong with my hair?”  “Nah. It ain’t like that Kid.” Blink’s hair had gone from looking like somebody had stuck a bowl over the top of his head and cut around it, to looking like a particularly unruly mop, but it wasn’t nice to say so. “I like your hair,” Mush said instead. He ran his hand down through it, to the nape of Blink’s neck. “It’s just starting to hide your face is all.”  “Yeah?” Blink’s voice was a lot softer now, and he leaned back against Mush’s touch. “You know the first thing about cutting hair?”  Mush bit back a laugh. “No, but I seen folks doing it. How hard could it be?”  Later Blink would joke that Mush had hypnotized him into letting him give him a haircut. Mush didn’t know what that meant. What he did know was the the cut was uneven and unruly, and yet somehow Blink still said it was the best one he’d ever had. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The sound of barking was noticeably absent when All for One came home. Tomura must have tired out the puppy. It was a gift and a lesson all in one: how to take care of your subordinates, how to inspire loyalty, how to dispose of something that had outlived its usefulness. Knives were best honed on steel, after all. Tomura was in the living room, playing a video game next to a pile of fur and blood. “It annoyed me,” he stated without looking away from the screen. All for One smiled. “My, Tomura, you certainly are a precocious child.” *~*TEXT*~*

He’d spent so much of his life being impenetrable, even when the chill reached right down to his bones.  Spot’s life was different now. He had sturdy steel toed boots. He had Crutchie who got up an hour before him to go to his teaching job, left a cup of hot coffee in the kitchen, and wrote out the words “good morning” in the frost on his car windshield. *~*TEXT*~*

Now David was shaking him awake, with a glare and a sour expression.  “Hear what?” Les asked.  “You were singing about tractors.” David said  tractor  as though it was a dirty word, but Les just smiled.  “Jack was playing that song in his car. It was really funny.”  David rolled his eyes, the way he often did when anybody mentioned Jack. “I should have known,” he muttered, turning over in his bed to go back to sleep. Les did the same, hoping he could get back to his dream of country music stardom. Or maybe pop music stardom, or even Broadway theatre. He wasn’t picky. *~*TEXT*~*

Crutchie was always among the first to be fed, even when he tried to hang back, seeing as he wasn’t any more destitute than the rest of the boys.  This morning, he tore off a piece of his bread to give to Jack, who tried to wave it away. Crutchie pressed the morsel into Jack’s hand, and leaned in to whisper in Jack’s ear.  “Pancakes,” he said. “And bacon. That’s what I’m going to make for us first chance I get.”  Jack just grinned. “We'se both of us the kind of guys who could burn water, and you know it.”  “Maybe,” Crutchie said. “If that’s all we got to burn, but one of these days I’m going to get ahold of syrup, flour, and milk, and burn us some pancakes.” *~*TEXT*~*

In this place, there is no one else that she would ask this deed of it.  He would sense any attempt to lie directly to his face as he had many times before.  She glares at him with flashing eyes.  "I have a way for you to make amends with me,  Father ."  A brief moment of hurt and surprise is what she senses that she would address him in such a way. She lets him past the erected barriers of her mind and senses his anger as he glares at her in the physical world.  "I will not. You cannot ask this of me, General Organa." He snarls ominously through his breathing mask.  "You wish to make amends. Then do what no one is able or strong enough to do."  For their tainted bloodline, she knows of no one else alive who can do what she is asking of him now. *~*TEXT*~*

That night, there was glitter and champagne. There was a dedicated bunch of teachers staying awake, at Dimity’s behest, to receive the new year. There was intemperance, and revelry.  There was Ada, and there was Hecate. And there was midnight.  When the bells rang out, Ada raised a conspiratorial eyebrow and kissed her full on the lips. In public. Hecate blushed, but interlaced their hands.  There was tasteful felicitation. And, from Dimity, boisterous whooping. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The night was long and steeped in wine. Katherine’s words were drenched with meaning.  “It’s not fair.”  Sarah, sitting across the bed from her, took her hand.  “I know.”  Their shared experiences were different. Sarah had never had an editor to stare down. She’d never had to deal with whispers that she’d only found work because of her father. Nonetheless, she did know. She knew more than Mr. Denton, with his knowledge of editors and his family clout. Katherine would have never chosen Mr. Denton to get drunk with and spill out her heart to.  Sarah Jacobs was a seamstress. She knew about lace, pretty needlework, and being underestimated. She, like Katherine, wanted more. Half a bottle of wine and a small flood of tears would never be enough for either of them. They had a world to change.  They had a century to shape. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Tonight was another sleepless night for Leo. He hated nights like this, when everything bad that's happened just hits him full force. All those time where he couldn't do anything to make the situation better made him frustrated with himself. He slowly began to despise himself and his general uselessness. He absolutely hated it. His eyes were the only reason Libra even accepted him in the first place. Why do they still bother with him?  He glanced at the window. He could very well throw himself out the window, but someone would probably stop him before he even hit the ground. He opened his eyes, faint blue lighting the room. These damn eyes are the reason his sister couldn't see. These damn eyes have almost gotten him killed on so many different occasions, none of which he was able to save himself from. As he mind went over every time he couldn't do anything, a few tears slipped from his eyes. He closed his eyes, an arm resting over his face to hide the tears now running down his cheeks. "...Useless bastard..." *~*TEXT*~*

David huffed out a frustrated breath.   “Fine,” he said.  “Then tell me.  Tell me how you do things in Brooklyn.”   Spot smiled slowly. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Daehyun sat at the table with a box of popcorn chicken in front of him, and Youngjae intensely engaged with a handheld console to the right. Something was on Daehyun’s mind, so the world around him became a blur.  He deeply wondered where they all would go from here—  “Dammit!”  His mind was brought back to reality by Youngjae’s sudden outburst and half his box of chicken gone.  Eyes widened, Daehyun’s head sharply turned to see a frustrated Youngjae reaching over, stuffing one in his mouth.  “Hey, these are mine!” Daehyun shouted, grabbing the box.  Youngjae looked at him. “So?” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*So Nick brought with him Judy’s carrot pen, after the Breakup Scene. Do you think, just before everything went south, right after he filled up the application form, he recorded something on the pen for her? *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Right after Nick filled up the ZPD Academy Application form, He deleted the incriminating recording. By recording his own voice over that one. Thank you for the opportunity, Carrots ... &lt;pause&gt; ... I love you. Nick looked up at his beloved rabbit... and everything came crashing down right then and there. He left her, trying hard to maintain his dignity... and holding back his tears. ——— Over the next month, he would play back his own words … and cry. One day, he decided he was through with the past. It was all water under the bridge. He needed to get on with life. He had always been a survivor, and he would stay a survivor. He deleted the recording. Then he settled on his sun chair just outside the stone bridge's arch, slurping his smoothie… Part of him was relieved that he can put all those “mistakes” behind him. Yet part of him kept reminding him that he had lost something… something irreplaceable… Something that left a bunny-shaped hole in his heart. He shut his eyes. ——— He thought he must be dreaming. Because he heard   that voice   Calling his name repeatedly But… he wasn’t dreaming. Nick? … Nick? *~*TEXT*~*

That's a big no-no, she reminds herself as she watches baked beans spill from her plastic spork back onto the tray below. Red said no funny business.  The thought of Ivy is enough to get her to sit up straight and smile for the first time in days. Whatever gunk Arkham scoots her way doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. Come Tuesday night, Harley will be sleeping at Pam's place, dressed in something other than eye-burning prison orange. And if she's hungry...  Well, Ivy's never been opposed to eating out. *~*TEXT*~*

It’s a startling realization, and without thinking he says: “Good god, I’m still alive.”  Daniela laughs, voice low and throaty from years of smoking. “Sweetheart, if the cyanide didn’t work, I doubt my age will kill you.”  And he shrugs and says: “We haven’t tried acid yet. Or maybe, when you die, I’ll let them cut me into pieces and then lie beside you in the grave.”  She wrinkles her nose, “You’re a beautiful mess, but I don’t need your bits near me, darling.”  He cannot help but laugh. Yesterday, he was young, and while he has not aged for decades, his wife does. She’ll be the death of him yet.    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The early morning light was coming in through the curtains, making shadows dance on the walls around them. Normal shadows, nothing to be afraid of.  Dean Winchester blinked sleepily and stretched, reaching out to run his fingers down Castiel's spine as he did. She stretched forward in response; facing away from him, the scars moving as she did.  Happy sighs and rustling sheets.  Turning over to face Dean, her blue eyes met green.  Fingers combing through blonde hair. Quiet giggles from fingers being ran over her skin. Small sounds of contentment.  Near silence. Not complete. The world never stopped making sound, so if it was... Well, they would need to get up. And right now, she didn't want to. She was quiet. He was quiet.  The world was quiet. Just for this moment.  The two of them in this tiny slice of heaven that they had made.  Dean reaches out and pulls her to his chest, hands tracing their way over her back.  A moment of no monsters. No evil things that go bump in the night. No angry words and no cruel fates.  No voices telling them otherwise.  Just the two of them moving together. *~*TEXT*~*

Stiles had kept quiet, analyzing his feelings after hearing Erica say  Derek’s dates.  “Stiles!” caused his full-out flail, his heart knocking against his ribs. “Are you alright?” Derek asked. No, Stiles was not alright. It was high time he made a move too. *~*TEXT*~*

The crowd cheered louder and Wufei blushed as he joined the others in waving their hips and slapping their inner thighs. They pulled their pants off when they drew their hands away leaving them in skin tight boxers.   They went on with the dance, waving their arms and shaking their hips.   The crowd was loving it.   When the song ended they each struck a pose and waited a few seconds before leaving the stage.   Trowa and Duo waved and blew kisses out to the still cheering crowd.   “That ladies and gentlemen was a performance from our best agents. If you enjoyed their dance please donate tonight.

*~*SUMMARY*~*In the very beginning, Peter Parker’s dreams of life before becoming a bona fide Avenger were slim, since all he had was Aunt May and a few flighty scholarships to universities. Now, as a apprentice and intern to Tony Stark along with the secret official title of Spider-man, his dreams seem much more reachable. Still, the west coast calls him, so on a whim he packs up his life (and friends) to kick-start his future a week early. Throw in some banjo music, two worried super soldiers, a half-deaf pug, a stolen car, illegal extraterrestrial substances, and some chimichangas, adult life for Peter seems much more interesting than he thought it would be four years ago. *~*SUMMARY*~*

Jack winked at him, just because it was funny to watch the way David rolled his eyes whenever he did that.   “I’ll make it worth your while,” Jack promised.  He punctuated his words by leaning over to kiss David’s mouth.   David regarded him steadily for a moment before nodding his agreement. *~*TEXT*~*

Eternia needed him, the protector of Castle Grayskull – but he could never be the true Adam.  Adora was possibly the one person in both their worlds who could understand.   It was different for her – Adora could be competent in a way Adam never could, at home in her skin.  She didn’t have to pretend to be useless and cowardly.   Etheria was her place…but part of him wished it could be his as well. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*How times passes at home *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*It had felt like they’d been in the Realm for an eternity.    The focus had been on getting home, and there had been no time to think about what might be happening at home, how much time might be passing at home.    The question of whether anyone had even noticed their absence had been partly answered by the encounter with Jimmy Whittaker.  Although, Eric had to admit that Whittaker wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed.  When they finally did get home, they discovered there was only ten minutes missing.   It had been the longest ten minutes of his life. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He was the only one who didn’t see her as a child.    Her mother, Mary, the Princess – they still saw Helena as a child.  Never mind that she’d been about to come out when Daisy had been killed – they still saw her as too young to handle it.  She’d turned away, turned towards society’s brightly sparkling lights.  Eventually she had turned towards Rudolph, Count Andrenyi.  He’d swept her off her feet, treated her as a woman, not a child.  Now, Helena knew she was only included in the plot because of him.  He would hold the knife for them both. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*There was nothing like hanging out in Sea City, Mary Anne thought.  Especially when they didn’t have to babysit anyone.  Not that she really minded baby-sitting when it fit into her schedule, but high school had made her schedule a lot tighter.    It had made all their schedules a lot tighter, but they had managed to fit in a week here together amid softball, art class and cheerleading.  A week to do nothing but sun themselves, flirt with cute strangers, and relax.    Soon enough they would have to start senior year of high school, but for now they had time. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Jenny Lynton has preferences *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Occasional trips to London were necessary, and she enjoyed seeing her father’s new additions to the townhouse, but Jenny much preferred the country.  Working in her stillroom or refurbishing rooms that the Dowager had let grow shabby held far more attraction for her than shopping or seeing a play.    Adam preferred the country as well, and Jenny enjoyed seeing Adam happy.  There was also the fact that she had found herself in an interesting condition again, and this time she didn’t intend to tell her father until he had a brand-new grandchild to admire.  That was how she preferred it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Kashtiliash and Kathryn have some regrets... *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*He wondered if she regretted becoming the Queen of Babylon.  Perhaps today she did, Kashtiliash thought, watching his queen Kathryn depart the throne room.  Today, when Babylon and Nantucket weren’t quite enemies, but not the friends they had once been.  Kashtiliash was grateful for all Nantucket had given him, including his life, but he would not bow to them.  Their dealings with Nantucket had to be conducted on an even footing, had to respect Babylon’s contributions.  Kashtiliash would ensure it, even if it meant dealing with an angry leopardess in his quarters.  After all, he was the King of Babylon.  ---   When he went to her later that evening, Kashtiliash approached cautiously.  Angry leopardesses had been known to lie in wait for their prey.  She was seated in her own room, looking out to where the new gardens were being created.  “Kathryn?”  She turned to face him.  “Kash.”  He wanted her to not be angry, to know that he did what was best for Babylon.  Her eyes met his, and she nodded.  “Just remember your promise.”  He nodded, thinking of their agreement to give their children an Islander education.  “I will.”  She smiled sadly.  “And I won’t forget my promise, either.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*She’d thought Avonlea was a spring paradise, when she’d ridden along the red dirt road under trees full of blossoms.  But now, with silvery frost on windowpanes and tree limbs, Anne was certain winter was her favorite season.  Especially when she had a bosom friend like Diana to share it with.    There were walks along snow-covered Lovers’ Lane, and cups of hot tea enjoyed while reading by the fire.  There was even the prospect of snuggling together under quilts with hot bricks at their feet.  Maybe, one day, if Anne was very lucky, they could sleep in the spare room. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*She was back.  It would not be the same as that first glorious season, the beginning.  A beginning she owed to Dottie, Kit and their refusal to go without her – a girl they’d never met, who had no other options.  Now Dottie had gone home, and Kit was playing for Racine.  More importantly, women playing baseball was no longer exciting, not with the “real” players coming home.  Marla had assumed – hoped, maybe - they would keep on playing, that there would be another season, that she wouldn’t need to fight.  But she was ready to fight to stay on the field. *~*TEXT*~*

He turned to kiss Iella before he became all business.  She watched them go, then hurried to her position.  She had her own role to play, instead of just waiting for them to bring each other back. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Miss Lemon's solution for boredom *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Miss Lemon brought up the mail and sorted it in her efficient way.  She was devoutly hoping for a letter requesting Mr. Poirot’s assistance – a matron with a missing Siamese cat, a debutante with stolen jewels.  Something, anything, to get him out of the flat.  His last case has ended two weeks ago, and he was driving her to misfile letters.  Luckily, she had discovered the mistake before he found it.  Nothing.  No letters, just bills.  Mr. Poirot needed a mystery, even if she had to create it herself.  At least she had no shortage of material to work from.    ***  His secretary had always been fond of cases involving jewel robberies, Poirot reflected.  He enjoyed one as well – they challenged the little gray cells, but were not quite as untidy as murder.  There was something about this one, however, that was not quite right.  It was almost too tidy and organized.  Much like Miss Lemon.  Finally, he made his way to Ariadne Oliver’s untidy sitting room.  “Poirot!  Fancy seeing you here.”  Mrs. Oliver said in between bites of an apple.  “I have come to thank you,” he said.  “For your assistance to Miss Lemon, and to myself.”  Mrs. Oliver smiled. *~*TEXT*~*

Lotor looked up as Allura stood there in a column of pink, her hand extended.  “Shall we dance?”  He took her hand.  “With pleasure, my princess.” *~*TEXT*~*

"I-I mean like chocolate rain, plants made out candy, ya know, that sort of stuff."  Suddenly, Morty heard someone from outside. As he looked behind him, he saw a bunny rabbit with sharp teeth in fancy clothes. "Oh good heavens!" said the bunny as he held a pocket watch. "I'm late! I'M STINKING LATE!" "What he hell is he possibly late for?" Morty thought. "Hey, WAIT!" Morty chased after the bunny and he said "Not now, little boy! I'm very late!"  As Morty followed the bunny, he went inside a hole. "What the?" Morty thought as he went inside it too. suddenly, he started to fall. "O-o-o-oh Sh-*-*-*-it!"  To be continued... *~*TEXT*~*

In the room was two men, one Sebastian Moran and one Jim Moriarty. Both held a bottle of wine in their hands as they curled in against each other, Jim’s body tucked perfectly under the man’s strong arms. “You know….Jim.” Sebastian trailed off for a moment, the combination of whisky and wine in his bloodstream bringing a slur to his speech. “Yeah, Seb?” Jim’s voice was high; It always was when he had drank alcohol. “You’re like a Christmas tree.” His voice hinted at a laugh that was already threatening to leave his chest when Jim sat up slightly, looking curiously at Sebastian. “How so?” Jim asked, giggling as he pressed a kiss Sebastian’s jaw. “You light up my life.” Sebastian laughed, taking a sip of the wine from the bottle. Jim rolled his eyes and gently slapped the man, laying back down on him, his head resting on Sebastian’s chest. “I’m breaking up with you.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“James Moriarty. What is the world is this?” Jim looked up from his book, closing it with curiosity spiking in him.  Sebastian had dropped by earlier that day, to deliver the presents he had bought the detective and the criminal, giving a hug to his boss and a handful of friendly compliments on the decor to Sherlock, who smiled proudly, boasting on his skills at decorating the flat for the impending holiday.  “Hm? What is what?” He stood up and walked towards the kitchen, where Sherlock was standing over an open present, his back blocking most of the view. He turned to make room for Jim to come beside him, looking in amusement at the consultant as he glanced over the items at the table.  Slowly, a smile grew on his face, and he looked over at Sherlock, a mischievous glint in his dark eyes.  “The tree isn’t the only thing getting lit this year.” *~*TEXT*~*

Which meant she was absolutely not the sort to be caught after her office hours, sitting on the edge of her desk while in a passionate embrace. Or so she thought.

I’ll just come back later. I’ll see you at practice, Coach Hall.”  “Bittle. If you tell them, I’ll kill you.”  Alice smacked Andy on the arm and gave him a disapproving look. There was no reason to scare the boy.   “Ok. I won’t say anything. But you should probably know that they all already know. The coaches’ office at Faber has very large windows. And isn’t very soundproof.”  “Go!”  The door clicked shut and Alice pressed her face into Andy’s shoulder. She needed to consider her options. Sure, she had tenure at Samwell, but she could probably get that at another school, right? *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*It's the start of Christmas break and Aizawa is surprised to find Shinsou waiting for him outside his office. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Aizawa was one of the last to leave the faculty room that evening. He was surprised to see Shinsou waiting for him by the office door, as it was 7pm and a good few hours after the students left for their Christmas break.     "Sensei, thought I'd drop by before heading home for the holidays." Shinsou greeted.     "There was no need for that." Aizawa told him.     "But I wanted to."     Aizawa was piqued for a split second, before replying, "Merry Christmas, Shinsou. You did well this year."     "I had a good teacher." The younger boy complimented, "Thank you, sensei."     To Aizawa's surprise, Shinsou lay a quick chaste kiss on his lips. He stood there, stunned as Shinsou stepped away.     "Mistletoe." Shinsou said, right before turning to head down the hallway.    Aizawa's cheeks burned, and he looked up. It was like what Shinsou said -- mistletoe, which Aizawa swore wasn't there earlier. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Roy just wanted to enjoy a nice cup of tea in his home. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Roy is sitting in his favorite (and only) armchair in his living room, quietly sipping tea and reading through the reports Hawkeye insisted he take home with him. It’s the weekend, and while for some that means hanging out with friends or partying, Roy just wants to finish his paperwork, maybe drink some whiskey and read a good book.   That plan is ruined when the wall next to him buckles inwards and practically explodes, plaster and wood flying everywhere as a figure crashes through it. Roy is too shocked to even blink as Fullmetal hops back up, wipes at the trickle of blood coming from his lip, and yells, “Is that all you’ve got, you asshole?!” before jumping right back through the hole in the wall into whatever fight tossed him inside. The first thought that crosses Roy’s mind is, “Look at that ass.” His second thought is that he should give Fullmetal some backup.   Riza’s going to shoot him for how dull his reactions had become. He didn’t even have his gloves near him. Whoops. Well, his excuse could be how distracting those leather pants were as Fullmetal hopped back into the fray. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Neville and Blaise enjoy an Advent calendar. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Neville opened an Advent calendar door, the perforated seam cutting neatly between Santa and a child on his lap. He placed the chocolate between his lips. Blaise captured Neville’s mouth, biting the chocolate in half. Neville moaned at the combination of sweet hazelnut and salty Blaise. Blaise’s fingers floated over Neville’s spine, making Neville shiver. He pulled Blaise into a deeper kiss, and for a while they knew only tangled limbs and pleasure. After, Blaise poked through an image of a snowball fight on the Advent calendar. When Neville protested it should wait, Blaise silenced him with another chocolate-coated kiss. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*with the kree gone, humanity keeps going. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Most of the Kree technology has been destroyed, and what is left they wouldn’t know how to use anyway.  They just have to hope that whatever the blues did to them throughout the years didn’t leave them all infertile or the final generation produced at the Lighthouse will be humanity’s last.  But there is a single humidicrib left completely intact.  Tess has it hooked up to two separate generators next to her bed, sleeps with her hand atop of it to make sure it’s still warm and working.  Everyone tells her not to get attached to the little human growing inside the contraption, that the tech might fail and they don’t have the knowledge to fix it, that the baby can’t survive without it, and no one is sure when it’s safe to take her out.  Loving the little one already would be very foolish indeed.  With her forehead pressed against the glass protecting her baby, Tess knows she is a fool. Or maybe she’s just a dreamer. Virgil’s wild tales turned out to be true. Why shouldn’t her hopes be fulfilled, too?  “You’ll be fine,”she whispers, and the baby squirms as she hears her voice.“I promise, Eve.” *~*TEXT*~*

And when he told Unicron, well, he was fragged off and left-"  " SKYWARP !" Sunstorm yelp-gasped.  Starscream couldn't help but laugh, and bent to scoop up the two now giggling sparklings.  "What?  Wait, Star, where are you going?" Skywarp asked, but Starscream was not sticking around for the lecture his mate was about to get.  "That was sacrilege, Skywarp!" Sunstorm snapped.  "I raised you better than-"  Starscream shut his berthroom door on the rest of Sunstorm's righteous rant and spilled Sideswipe and Sunstreaker onto the berth.  He crawled over the chirping and giggling twins and decided a less serious story would perhaps be better for them today. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*It is impossible to make panic poetic. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*It is impossible to make panic poetic. Sadness, sorrow, and solemnity have forms that flow into words. Patterns can be pieced together, creating a collection of words that can be called a poem. Panic has no patterns. No one takes joy in the disjoint phrases, feelings and figures that infect one’s mind. Like a drop of rancid oil, panic races through the body, destroying any depictions of order. Decisions halt as delinquent memories demand a hearing. Emotions invade the intellect but oscillate rapidly. Nerves deteriorate under the onslaught. Senses should decay but rather are sharpened. Panic is a drug—it illuminates everything and magnifies the invisible. Anchors appear—a stable structure on which one’s being can rest—relax—be at peace…but the surface dissolves into mist, plunging one’s purpose off the precipice. The poem shatters at the base, panic begins anew.  It is impossible to make panic poetic. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Technological death invites muse to play; Whirlwind of thoughts throw her out. Instant replay, constant color keeps us deaf to muse’s freeing power. Or do I seek to distract myself from the demons I fear inside? Am I more afraid of the truth creativity unleashes than the saltine crunch of someone else’s laundered ideas? Technological life lets muse have voice; Self-deprecation chokes her scream. Scrolling faster, constant motion kills ideas. Information overload. Or is it safer to mute the voice inside, to keep the lion locked in Daniel’s den? The intensity inherent keeps me away even thought it might be the one think that keeps me sane. I fear the power from the poet within. *~*TEXT*~*

On his wrist, there was nothing but pure, untouched, pale skin.  But his brother? His brother had the tattoo of a bunny, crouched in the shadow of a lion.  His mother? A heart tangled in fairy lights. The same as his dad.  It hurt, knowing he was broken. Knowing there was no one out there for him.  But over the years, he grew to accept it. To accept the fact he was alone. To accept the fact that he was, ultimately, worthless.  It wasn’t until now, that he learned that he wasn’t alone. Wasn’t alone in being alone. Being weird. Being worthless.  Sebastian was just as alone as he was. He had nothing on his wrist.  Just as worthless, just as alone, just as broken.  But, two broken pieces that fit together to form a whole.  Out of the dust of two broken things, something new was formed.  Maybe he wasn’t as alone as he thought he was. *~*TEXT*~*

Dammit, he’s pulls it off well.  She kissed him softly. “Just make sure you don’t drink too much at our reception,” she murmured. “I don’t want you passing out on our wedding night.”  Seb chuckled. “Scout’s honor.”  Molly grinned. “You are the complete opposite of a Boy Scout.”  “Fiancé’s honor?”  “That works.” She kissed him again. “And you’re my Secret Santa too.”  Seb laughed softly. *~*TEXT*~*

What is  that ?”   Chuuya looks Dazai up and down, the faintest of sneers curling on his lips, sapphire eyes flashing with… offense?   The man in question just flashes his largest grin. “It’s an ugly Christmas sweater!”   All at once, several thoughts hit Chuuya.   Thought the First: they don’t even  celebrate  Christmas. Thought the Second: Dazai is banned from most clothing stores due to acts public indecency. Thought the Third: where did he get it?

*~*TEXT*~*"You came all this way for answers. Only currency I have." Said Ulysses, his stance standoffish, dreadlocked hair looking slightly frazzled. The soft red glow of the divide reflected dully on his skin. Lizzie had convinced him to stand down and now they were sitting in the men's military barracks in Hopeville.  Half of the windows of the barracks were smashed and the other half were so dirty that you couldn't see fuck-all out of them. Lizzie sighed and looked at them, the dangling marked man corpse that was half-hung out of one of the smashed ones. After a moment of contemplation, she turned her head back to Ulysses and spoke softly.  "I did, but you don't have to consider them currency. You owe me nothing." She said. Ulysses blinked and tilted his head slightly. He laughed, a low deep rumble.   "Now that's the answer I expected of you, Courier Six." He said, brown eyes softening slightly. Lizzie grinned and reached across the table to take Ulysses' hand, he reached back.  "You can call me Lizzie, you know, we were siblings once." She said, glancing at their linked hands. Ulysses looked Lizzie in the eyes, smiling. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Traveling with Gamora and the Guardians was a good idea, Natasha thought as she watched the Guardians work on their weapons and move among each with such ease that she hadn't seen anywhere outside of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers.  There were supposedly good things according to Rogers and Fury that they could learn from teaming up with the Guardians.  Natasha hadn't expected though that she would end up taking the fiercely beautiful Gamora to bed after a rough tenth mission with the team. She's woken up first and finds herself watching Gamora as she slept calmly, bathed in starlight through the window of her quarters.  Gamora sighed in her sleep as she turned towards Natasha to rest her head slightly on Nat's chest. *~*TEXT*~*

It'd been a mistake to fall into bed with Stark and Strange, but it would probably be one of the best mistakes that she had ever made as she watches both men doze in their shared bed. Right up there with not following orders to kill Clint for the Red Room and joining Shield. Gently, she moves them around with only mild complaints from either of them before settling in between them on the soft mattress. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*First year, Harry was a sweet spark of light Snape wished to hold gently in his palm.  Second year brought the earliest signs of manhood, but Harry’s youth remained bright.  Third year, turbulence grew evident in his eyes, and Snape wanted to sooth him but spoke cruel words instead.  Fourth year, darkness latched onto Harry’s features: brow furrowed, lips tense.  Fifth year he looked enough like a man that Snape felt less guilty for his longing.  But six was the year Snape realized he was utterly unworthy of Harry’s affection, and seven was the year Severus got to say goodbye. *~*TEXT*~*

At times, she fell asleep on Ayla’s lap.  Once, Ayla found her scratching at the magic invisible door in Crono’s room.  The door slid up, and stuck.  Tiger tucked under her arm, Ayla climbed down.  “Go,” Ayla told her.  “Protect hut.  Protect hunting ground.  Find mate; bear many strong children.”  The tiger darted off into the grass.  Ayla smiled. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Howard?”  “Yes, Vince?”  “Can we get some balloons?”  “I suppose, little man.  What do you want balloons for, anyway?”  “To brighten up our room.  It’s well drab in there what with all your different shades of beige. Help me pick them?”  Vince didn’t give Howard any time to answer, grabbing him by the hand and dragging him a couple of aisles over.  “See, there’s so many to choose from. These come in neon colors, those glow in the dark, and those other ones are supposed to be extra large.”  Howard stared in horror at the display Vince was gesturing at.  “Vince, you do know… these are for… I think we’re on the wrong…”  “You’re not making sense, Howard.  Anyway, I think we should just get a bunch of different kinds.  It’ll be well colorful.”  Vince happily began picking up different boxes and putting them in his basket.  “Vince, these are condoms,” Howard managed to announce in a loud whisper.  His faced turned crimson and he stared at the floor.  “I know that Howard, but they can still brighten up our room.”  Vince gave Howard a look.   “Oh. I see.”  Vince squeezed Howard’s hand and then skipped off toward the checkout. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Going through my old files and found a short edgy(TM) ficlet from like 2011-2013ish? You knows. Decided to rewrite it as a proper double drabble because I'm been obsessed with practicing short-form fiction as of late. Not sure how I feel about it, but if sneeze girl gets to flood this show's ao3 section then so do I lol   I got Royal Heights vibes from the original -- which is an El Tigre/Invader Zim/YYY boarding school!AU fic my ex girlfriend wrote many years ago -- so I decided to keep that, though make Yuck human because that's how how it be. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Ping. Ping. Ping.   Who knew bats made that sound, even when smashed against human heads?  Well, ‘human’ is an operative word; she’s little more than an old doll now. Limp, limbs bent at all the wrong angles.  He snaps his fingers and the mess is gone. No fans of blood. No brain matter stuck to the furniture like gums that’s had its flavored all chewed out.  But still it echoes.  Ping. Ping. Ping.   He can’t help but smile. Wishes he’d taken a picture before he cleaned up.  His senses are so acute he can hear the school sleeping around him, hear the building itself breathe and shift and settle.  He doesn’t remember even getting out of bed.  They’ll probably send the scanner-bot out soon, checking his bed for the human who likes to sleep curled at the edge of the bed like a cat.  Or at the Night Master’s feet like a dog.  He lifts his dirty fingers to his lips and tastes.  Well, nothing left for him here. Yuck turns off the lights of the science room as he quits to beat the scanner, practically skipping as the taste of copper burns his teeth.  ‘Human’ is an operative word. *~*TEXT*~*

He bit Zac’s lower lip lightly, teasing, and Zac grabbed Matty’s hips to pull him down closer.  “Mmmm,” Matty moaned as Zac’s tongue worked his mouth.   “Quiet or the director will catch us,” Zac whispered.  “Don’t care,” Matty said, breathless, then lunged for Zac’s lips again, hands roaming everywhere, claiming Zac’s body for his own, relentless.  “Zac? Zac!”  “What?”  “What are you doing?”  “Uhh… thinking?”  “Thinking about what?”  “A script?”  “Zac, you were obviously fantasizing about something. That’s okay. It’s perfectly natural to have fantasies. But when your husband is calling you to bed, maybe focus on what’s in front of you?”   “Right. Sorry, Matty. Be right there.”  Zac sighed. There was no dignified way of explaining to your hot husband that you were fantasizing about having sex with your hot husband instead of actually going to have sex with your hot husband. There would be no living it down. *~*TEXT*~*

"Happy to know that my hands are good for something."  "The rest of you is acceptable as well."  Dorian snickered softly as the cold night settled in around them. *~*TEXT*~*

"Now, Barry, don't be a sore loser," he says, laying on the drawl extra-thick, and Barry can't help but notice that he's not even bothering to deny the cheating while making it look like  Barry's  being the unreasonable one.  There's a smirk on Leonard's face as if he'd just pulled off a heist right under the Flash's nose and his gaze travels up and down Barry's form with an intensity like he's won more than just a get-out-of-jail-free card, the blatant suggestiveness driving a rush of heat to Barry's face. "What do you say, Scarlet... double or nothing?" *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*There they are again: Jake tied to a chair, Shadow Man kneeling before him, working on the bonds. But something's different this time around. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*"I don't know how you keep getting yourself into these situations," Shadow Man chides Jake while working on the harsh, uncomfortable ties that hold his feet in place, and Jakes tries hard – so hard – to focus on important things like a witty comeback or how to defeat the as-of-yet unnamed villain who captured him, but it's not easy when all his attention is soaked up by how long and clever the other man's fingers are, what quick work they make of the bonds.  "Do you and whatshisname have some kind of turf war going on?" Jake wants to know, too curious for his own good, "like... don't get me wrong, Declan, it's not that I'm not grateful for the rescue and all, but helping the hero escape isn't exactly in the villain handbook?" "The only person who's allowed to defeat you and tie you up is me," Declan says with an uncharacteristic hint of petulance in his tone, a possessiveness that should by no means be endearing (but totally is), but before Jake has a chance to power through the inappropriate rush of fondness and come up with a suitable response, they're being shot at and running for their lives. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The alert pings on all their phones at the same time, an electronic symphony of rumors reminiscent of days long gone:  SPOTTED: Lonely Boy out on what looks like a clandestine rendezvous with Mrs. Blair Bass – uh-oh! careful, you two! – Chuck Bass won't be too happy seeing his wife rekindle old flames...   "If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to get a rise out of me, Humphrey," Chuck says, low and dangerous, pinning Dan down with unrelenting hands.  "I have no idea what you —" Dan doesn't get to finish the thought, words turning into a moan as Chuck's mouth fastens on his neck with the single-minded intent of turning him incoherent, tongue slowly trailing up the red lines Blair's fingernails left, and the silvery sound of Blair's laughter fills the room. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Bobo flinches and bites back the awkward, needy sound that's lodged deep in his throat when Manfred clasps his shoulder, his hand strong and warm even though the cotton of Bobo's shirt.   It's an innocent enough gesture, casually friendly in the way Manfred has always acted around him – nothing about it should make Bobo's stomach drop in an uncomfortable mixture of arousal, embarrassment and regret, but he can't shake the memories of being stretched out at Manfred's feet with the other man's hands gently petting his fur.  "You okay?" Manfred asks with a frown, and Bobo smiles and nods and silently curses Fiji's spell. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*her grandmother's stories have not prepared raina for reality. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Raina had always thought that the angels would grant her a gift, and she would be able to achieve some sort of purpose, to help her people. By the time she receives and embraces her gift, she has realised that she has no people. She has been shunned by humans for her transformation - should have perhaps seen that coming from a life of manipulating others into what she needed to stay alive. They never wanted to help her, not really. So why should she help them? Even the other Inhumans flinch at the sight of her. She is too different, and they fear different. “You’re not like them,”Sinara tells her, and from her mouth it’s a compliment. She does not look at Raina with the revulsion she will never quite get used to. She does not even shy away from touching her; she cut herself, the first time, and simply chuckled. And so Raina, who could tell the Kree anything, could help the humans with false visions, gives Kasius nothing but the truth. She has no people, no desire to protect those who cast her out, but she has Sinara. At her side, she can be an angel, too. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Imagine driving in your pickup truck. Hidden from the world and only the two of us. Away from the paparazzi and the show and all the critics. Going where ever we want. Driving late into the night. Then falling asleep in the bed of the trunk; wrapped up together under the stars.  Imagine bubble baths. Our body’s lounging together. Drinking champagne and enjoying each other’s company.   Imagine pictures that we chose to post getting the most likes, comments, and views. Because everyone is jealous of our golden life.  Imagine the nights when we can lay in bed. Naked. Soft kisses. Sweet caresses. Loving words. My head on your chest or yours in my neck. Fitted so perfectly.  Imagine telling each other all of our secrets. Knowing each other like the back of our hands. Having someone in this cold world understand.  Imagine being king and queen of our household. Protecting each other against the world.   Imagine a thousand kisses that we could exchange.  Imagine a world like that. But you can’t. Because we were both stupid. And we let heaven slip through our fingers going through hell. I guess we forgot that you can’t buy love. Only rent it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*He's always thought that there was no reason to tell her that he loved her, until it's too late. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Sometimes Roy would imagine looking at Riza Hawkeye. Sometimes he would imagine saying three dangerous and forbidden words. But even in this fantasy, he knew that telling Hawkeye that he was in love with her would be foolish. He might as well have pointed upward and said, “look, Lieutenant, the sky is blue”.  “Of course, it is, sir,” she would say. Of course, you are, sir, she would say. And so, he should not regret never telling her. She knows. The language that they speak together has never required words.  Yet, as the world falls to pieces around him, regret is a bitter companion. He’s always known that a happy ending was not in their stars. But as the sword bites, cold and unforgiving, into her vulnerable neck, Roy wishes that fate had been a little kinder. Blood splatters from her wound and she is thrust violently to the ground. They are out of time. The words he has kept secret on his tongue shrivel and die, and with them, so does his heart. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Adora and Glimmer lie together on a bed suspended as high as their love makes them feel, soaring through the skies in an infinite bliss. Facing each other, making a heart with their entwined bodies they are in a state free from the cares or Etheria, free from the deathly howls of the Horde Army, free from the trauma of an intertwined past.   Adora looks at her beloved and sighs, running her hand through Glimmer's bubblegum hair, mesmerized by the sparkles that fill the air, she giggles and coos "You glimmer, Glimmer!”  “Adoraa” Glimmer protests, “its embarrassing, im not just sparkly you know”  Adora smiles and stares into Glimmers eyes, “Of course I know that, sparks couldn't set this fire you have made in my heart.”  Glimmer squeals and snuggles deeper into her loves chest and Adora rests her head on the top of her beloved. They quickly drift to a slumber neither thought possible before.       Next morning, Bow walks in to see what is keeping Glimmer for so long, and upon seeing Glimadora cuddling squeals so loud he awakens all of Bright Moon *~*TEXT*~*

Ask me only for something I would give. I’d offer you my raw and beating heart; To losing that, by now I’m quite resigned.

But the questions are the same, the wine still too dry, and the horseradish burns your nose. You want change, but it never touches you, and seemingly never will. You stand and open the door for the prophet, wind rushing in and blowing out candles.  Blue eyes staring back instead of darkness, and you allow him inside. He drains the wine from Elijah's cup and smiles. You understand liberation, and smile back. Things will change. Dayenu. *~*TEXT*~*

How many have you gotten to?”   “Two on your arm, and five on your chest and neck.”  Thor chuckled, a sound that sent tingles down Bruce’s spine. “Believe me, there is more elsewhere.”  Mere seconds later, Thor’s shirt was on the floor as Bruce gently pressed his finger tip on each and every scar he could see.  “Where is this one from?”   “You, my dear.” *~*TEXT*~*

Stiles launches himself towards Derek, knocking him over. “ Yesyesyes …” he repeats like a mantra, peppering Derek’s face with kisses.

*~*SUMMARY*~*the one where stiles goes back...  sterek drabble - 3/16 - words of the day: evening, amuse, realize *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*It amuses Stiles how easy it is to find the right witch willing to create the portal. It  could  also be that he now knows exactly what to look for…  He shares a tearful goodbye with Scott once his friend realizes that he’s not coming back. The witch explained that while uncomplicated, it’s generally unsafe to continually open a portal between dimensions.  After spending one last evening with his father, Stiles heads to the woods to meet the witch. When he left the other world, he was jittery and nervous, but not now. Now he feels calm and at peace. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*the one where stiles leaves...  sterek drabble - 6/27 - words of the day: withdraw, touch, hover *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Stiles hovers over Derek. His eyes roam over Derek’s face, memorizing every detail. He presses their lips together, trying to convey just how much love he feels. Touching their foreheads together, he sighs heavily.  “Thank you, Derek. I don’t-“ his voice cracks.  “ Shh … let’s just… I just want to hold you before you go.”  “Okay.”  Bodies molded together, they just lie there. Holding on to their last moment.  Light wakes him the next morning. Tears fill his eyes. Not wanting to leave, but knowing he can’t stay,  shouldn’t  stay, he withdraws. Looking back at Derek’s sleeping form, he whispers goodbye. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Standing in the kitchen, trying to bake away his troubles, Stiles is startled when a hand grips his shoulder.  “Son.”  Turning, looking at his father, he says, “yo daddio,” with none of his normal enthusiasm.  “You’ve been hanging around here for two weeks. I didn’t want to say anything, but it’s almost like you’re grieving again.”  It’s like a dam bursts and tears fall. “I miss him dad.”  Being the intuitive man that he is, Stiles isn’t surprised by the words his father speaks. “I love you, son, but I don’t think you should stay. If there’s a way back…”    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Stiles has been back for a week and even though he’s reunited with his dad and Scott, his heart still aches. Stepping into the loft, it bleeds with each memory that floods his head, his last night there, of  every  moment with his mate. Licking his metaphorical wounds, he packs his bags. Stiles is hopeful that his father will let him stay in his old room at the house. He knows though that that’s not what the problem is.   This isn’t home . He can feel the invisible threads wanting to pull him back to the other world, back to Derek. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*There’s a breeze in the air as Stiles peers through the kitchen window. Watching his father make bacon, he chuckles, only  slightly  annoyed at his absence being taken advantage of. Knowing the sheriff keeps the back door unlocked, he enters softly, wanting to surprise the man.  “Too much salt…” his voice breaks as his father turns.  His father drops the pan, rushing across the room, pulling him into a hug. “ Stiles …”  “I’m sorry dad. I didn’t know...”  “What happened? One day you were here, and suddenly you weren’t…”  Stiles fills him in. On the spell, seeing Derek, the parallel dimension. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*After re-reading over the literature, Stiles has to throw the book across the room.  Why now ?  “It’s not fair,” he says, bitterly, when he feels Derek walk into the room. Arms wrap around his waist, pulling him close. “I don’t wanna go.”  “It wouldn’t be fair for you to be trapped here. What about your dad? Scott? The pack? I know you miss them.”  He leans back against Derek, trying to fight back tears. “I do. I do. I just- I’m going to miss you.” Turning in Derek’s arms, he wraps his arms around the man, letting emotion overcome him. *~*TEXT*~*

His stomach clenches at the thought of leaving Derek after having grown so close, after allowing himself to care for the man. But there’s also a pang in heart at the thought of seeing his father and Scott.  The spell’s not complicated and if he wanted, he could leave tomorrow. It almost seems too easy. A portal. That’s all it’ll take to get him home. The right witch and a portal.  Pouring over the words again, he feels frustrated and confused. *~*TEXT*~*

With red eyes and claws out, Derek yells at the intruder. “ Really ?! It’s the middle of the night!”  “A little extreme, huh, Der. I mean, claws? For lil’ old me?” a smirk sits on Mischief’s face as he leans over the counter.  Stiles walks forward. “What’s up?”  “Brought you a present.” Holding a book out to Stiles, Mischief says, “I know how to get you home.” *~*TEXT*~*

"It's a fruitcake." Gibbs repeated.  "It is a fruitcake the way a bicycle is transportation." Tony eyed it lovingly. "There are only so many of these made a year. You have to be on their list to get one. I've been on standby to the list for over five years."  "To buy a fruitcake."  "A "Great-Aunt Bess' Traditionally Prepared and Aged Special Homemade Heavenly Pecan Fruitcake," Gibbs." Tony said in exasperation. "If you don't show the proper respect, I won't share it with you."  "That's alright. I already have my own fruitcake." Gibbs snickered in his coffee. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It was war, plain and simple.  War, between two sides of the same coin. Spread out within the boundaries of the known. There would be casualties, but that was the price of war.     “Where the fuck are you hiding?” Sebastian grumbled quietly, crouching as he came slowly alongside the flat.     The sky was a light grey, the ground covered in a layer of fluffy, cold white. Flurries of snow still fell from the sky, settling in his ginger hair. In his mitted hand was a snowball, ready to be thrown at a moments notice.     Without warning, a cascade of snow fell upon him, pinning him to the ground. A burst of laughter was heard from above, and with blurry eyes he looked to see two Jim’s on the roof, laughing merrily at him. The two Jim’s, which as his vision cleared, he recognised as Richard and Jim, high-fived.     “You two are assholes.” He muttered, but the smile that graced his face said otherwise as he sat up and brushed the snow off of him. Jim jumped down as placed a kiss to a rosy cheek, “But isn’t that why you love me, tiger?” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*She is smiling.  To him, only him. Eyes sparkling, holding his gaze within those warm shades of brown.  He can see only her, nothing else. It’s like the rest of the world simply disappeared and it’s just the two of them left.  She is smiling, and it feels like he is drowning.  But it can’t last long. Already her smile is slowly fading, brown eyes, sparking with the light of life, slowly slipping closed.   He can’t breathe.   And when her smile finally falls, he falls too.   His knees hit the ground and catches her just in time.   He still can’t breathe as he holds her still body in his arms.   Even as tears form in the corners of his eyes and fall silently, he knows her beautiful smile is etched in his memory forever.   Fin *~*TEXT*~*

Revolution's wheel may not complete its cycle under this summer sky, but he must make himself a gear in its turning nonetheless, and he must declare his claim to a life fuller in this moment than he'd long been able to dream of.   Though changed, there is the part of him still that must deferentially ask Enjolras's permission to take a liberty; and it is stranger than anything, burningly beautiful where the rest of Grantaire's revelations only burn, that now, Enjolras will accept that part too.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Stiles didn’t think the possibility existed for him to find love again. Or at least something that could lead to it. Using Derek’s chest as a pillow, gliding his fingers lazily over the exposed skin, he feels vibrations as Derek practically  purrs  at his touch. “Mmm… I didn’t realize werewolves were like cats… here I’ve been making dog jokes for years…”  Derek wraps him in his arms, laughing with his whole body. “Dog jokes? Really, Stiles?”  “Eh, it works…” He rises up, coming face to face with Derek.  “Are you really okay with this, Stiles?”  Stiles answers with a kiss. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*They’re soaked by the time they get home. Stiles laughs at being tossed over Derek’s shoulder like a ragdoll.  “It was faster if I carried you. We’d still be out there if you had to run.”  “Aww, you’d have stayed behind for poor little me?”  “ Yes .” There’s a vulnerability in Derek’s face that Stiles hasn’t seen before.  His heart swells, shattering the ring of pain that usually surrounds it. “ Derek .” Stepping up to the man, Stiles wraps his arms around him, pulling Derek into a tight embrace. “I don’t know how much I’m ready for, but I want to try.”       *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Stiles tries not to linger on the broad expanse of naked chest. His eyes trail up over the well-groomed beard to Derek’s kaleidoscope eyes. “Ahem, it’s a good day for swim?” voice cracking, he swallows hard, trying to stamp out the desire that’s wafting from his body.  “Are you asking me?” Derek steps up to him, almost chest to chest.  The smirk on Derek’s face tells Stiles that he knows exactly what he’s doing. Stiles’ fingers tremble as he lays a hand on the man’s chest. But before Stiles can do anything more, thunder booms and rain pelts the ground. *~*TEXT*~*

A bright smile replaces his calm expression.  Derek glides through the water with ease. Seeing Derek’s clothes and towel laid out on the grass, Stiles walks towards them, trying and failing not to look at the naked man emerging from the water. Grabbing the towel, he holds it out as Derek approaches, hoping his face doesn’t reveal where his thoughts lie. From the look on  Derek’s  face, he failed. *~*TEXT*~*

With the leaves crunching on the ground beneath his feet, his mind wanders to his father, to Scott, to the pack he left behind. He misses them, fiercely, but he also thinks about what would happen if he did get the chance to return home. He’s calm here, with Derek. He’s already lost the man once, could he bare to do it again? This might not be  his  Derek, and they might never progress past anything more than liking each other and friendship, but he’s still  Derek . *~*TEXT*~*

Should he feel so ready to move on?  A silent tear falls as he sits on his bed thinking about the past. The bed dips beside him, but he’s not startled by it. More and more he’s become in tune with  this  Derek. Sensing his presence,  feeling  his emotions… knowing the minute the man’s interest shifted from Mischief onto him, doing nothing to stop it. Stiles should feel guilty, but he doesn’t… *~*TEXT*~*

He pushes away. “I- I-“  Derek reaches for him, but he runs from the building. Stopping in the alley to catch his breath, he slides down and sits against the wall.  Nearby footfalls tell him he’s been found. Looking up, he can see the worried look in Derek’s eyes. “Stiles? I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have-”  “It’s- well, not okay, but we were caught up in the moment.”  “I’m still sorry.”  “Don’t be.” *~*TEXT*~*

Derek bites his lip, suppressing a giggle. “It’s alright. It’s art. It’ll inspire me.”  “I can’t believe you’re an artist. Or that you chose the shortest building because you’re scared of  heights … I mean, what is that?!”  “Are you…  making fun of me ?” Derek’s eyes sparkle as he lunges forward, wrapping Stiles in a tight embrace.  Stiles’ eyes flicker to Derek’s lips and he leans forward.    *~*TEXT*~*

Erica mentioned it. Something about a studio.”  “Uh, yeah. I paint. I actually have to head there today. Would you like to accompany me?”  “Wow, all formal… do I have to dress up?

Feathering light touches where he knows worry lines tend to form, teasing him when he wakes up about how soft he looks when he sleeps. But  this  Derek doesn’t have those. Funnily enough,  this  Derek never carried around that guilt, even though they both shared the same hard life.  Hazel eyes catch him staring and Stiles offers a shy smile. “Sorry.” Unwrapping himself from the were, he says, “I kinda passed out on you.”  “It’s alright, Stiles. I know that you haven’t been sleeping well. ” *~*TEXT*~*

Unsure of when he fell asleep, he can’t help but notice that he’s snuggling against Derek when he wakes or that it’s the best night’s sleep he’s had in weeks. *~*TEXT*~*

After spending so much time with the were, Stiles is starting to notice the small differences that set this Derek apart from  his  Derek. The immediate caring and openness, rather than the miles of walls Stiles had to break down. He looks on as warmth fills his heart. *~*TEXT*~*

I can see how hard it is  for you  to not have them here.” Derek nods. “Yeah, it has been. We usually have weekly gatherings.” “So let’s have one. Call them. We’ll barbeque this weekend.

Passionately. Hands grabbing his face in place, tongue twisting inside his mouth. Hands pulling his hair, making him feel dizzy. Leaving him just as quick, gasping for air. Eyes wide open, face flushed. Malfoy went back to his place, took a gulp of Firewhisky, and spun the bottle. "Woooooow." - The crowd cheered again as the bottle stopped and pointed to Potter. Harry might have died just then and there, he hasn't recovered from the first kiss yet and Malfoy was sautering back to him, lust clouding his amazing grey eyes. *~*TEXT*~*

"Now that's epic." Deaky disco danced while slapping his fresh pepperoni penpen popo nipples.   Some girl dressed as a stick of gum came in and stole the heels. Freddie ran up to her and smacked her with a condom full of frozen diet coke and she fucking died. *~*TEXT*~*

Disclaimer: The characters belong to JK Rowling. I'm just borrowing them and promise to return them unscathed. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Harry sighed and stretched out on his towel, his hands folded under his head. “This place is amazing,” he said.  Draco was laid on his side, head propped up on one hand. “I knew you’d like it here,” he said, smiling. “Mother used to bring me here when I was younger.”  “Why doesn’t that surprise me?” Harry chuckled, mirroring Draco’s position now.  Draco grinned. “What can I say, Mother always had the best taste in holiday destinations,” he said. “Plus, she wanted me to learn French.”  Harry rolled his eyes goodnaturedly. “And did you?”   “En effet j'ai fait,”  Draco replied with another grin.  Harry gave a soft groan. “Merlin, that’s hot,” he said.  Draco quirked an eyebrow.  “Tu m'aimes parler français, Harry?”  Harry moaned again softly. “I have no idea what you just said, but please say something else.”  Draco gave a wicked grin and shuffled closer, glad they were on a private beach.  “Je veux embrasser chaque pouce de toi,”  he whispered.  “Jusqu'à ce que tu hurles mon nom.”  “Merlin, Draco, kiss me,” Harry moaned, pulling Draco closer.  Draco grinned against Harry’s mouth, only too happy to oblige. This holiday was going to be the best he’d ever had. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Author's note: Look what I am doing instead of finishing another story! Okay in this Donald is an animal telepath. He can talk to other animals and they can talk to him. He is effected by them as well. Around carnivorous animals he will have a very meaty diet while and herbivores he was have more plants. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Donald clenched his beak as he walked down the gangplank to the dock, setting foot on dry land for the first time in eight years. He had not spoken to Della and Uncle Scrooge in that long as well. He bitterly remembered the venomous words they had spit at him when he announced he was joining the Navy. He had left and vowed to never come back until they had apologised. He refused to go back to the mansion. Thankfully, Mr. Meowsrani's offer made it so he didn't have too. Donald straightened up and walked swiftly to his escort. It was time to go to Isla Nublar.  Scarcely three months later, Donald knelt in front of four little eggs. They had done it. His little Raptors will hatch any day now, in fact.... the cracking of eggshells began to fill the air as the baby dinosaurs within fought their way out. Finally, one of them broke free and almost tumbled to the ground if Donald had not caught her.   "Hello, Blue."  "Hello, Alpha daddy!"  Donald smiled as the words echoed in his mind. There was a reason after all he was so good with animals. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~* “You know, this would be a whole lot easier if we used our, I don't know, wands?”  Pansy's words were stripped of their bitterness by the soft, warm laughter that worked their way in between the syllables. She rested her cheek upon the soft chestnut hair, her smile softening as Cedric hummed happily as he stepped around the tree. The soft glow of the fairy lights gave the room a soft glow that filled her with warmth.  “I enjoy the hands-on approach.” He murmured, his voice as warm as the light. Hanging another ornament up on one of the lower branches, she could feel his rich laughter rumble through him. “Are you gonna put another one up there? Balance out the gold with the silver?”  “Of course I am.” She huffed back at him, squeezing her thighs gently around his head and giggling as his free hand tickled the back of her knee. She summoned one of the ornaments from the box off to the side and put the silver star on one of the branches.  Christmas had never felt so special as it did when she was with him.           *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Walking through orderly rows of pines at a Christmas tree farm was not the same as finding one in the woods, but far less destructive to nature and so, fine with them both. “This one has such soft needles!” Stiles announced, petting them in a way all too familiar to Derek. Even after toppling their selected tree with a few axe chops, binding it up and securing it to the Camaro’s roof, Derek still couldn’t stop thinking of Stiles’s hands, carding through his hair, stroking his skin. Setting up the Christmas tree was definitely getting delayed once they’d returned home. *~*TEXT*~*

This boy  is  his territory—  No. The wolf growls, flexes his claws. The same claws that had dug into the boy’s chest.  Not enough, not enough.   Stiles , he remembers.  Stiles. His.   He’s hit with the force of it: the need to touch, to  claim  in whatever way his wolf still can. He reaches out and he’s pulled into a dream (not that Derek dreams, not that he can).  He feels happy… Playful, even. Like he’s exactly where he should be.  Stiles’s hands are warm and Derek can smell sweat and skin and cinnamon and the sizzle of magic. He rubs his nose against the boy’s throat and his fangs itch. He rests his teeth against the fine pale skin, dotted here and there with moles.  Laughing, Stiles’s long fingers slip into Derek’s hair, hold him close, tell him to  take .  Derek bites down and the laugh becomes a groan, Derek’s hands run over Stiles’s body.  Over his—  His .  The dream ends, leaving Derek to stagger, disappear. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“I left the door open,” says Michael in Dean’s voice, and Sam carefully files that away at the back of his mind in the catalogue of horrors to which he can never return. It’s another reason to be fervently grateful that Lucifer’s dead (he is dead; he is). Otherwise, how could Sam ever be sure that he wouldn’t wake to find himself under hostile occupation? It would be the same as, worse than, after Gadreel, when he’d check clocks compulsively to follow the passing of time, clinging to the continuity of each successive minute like a rope that could anchor him to his own reality. It would be like the time after the wall came down, when he was never certain that he was in his own skin.  (When was the last time he felt those fears? Sam stops and tucks that thought away alongside the other.) (That evening, he calls Rowena. “Lucifer’s dead?” “He’s dead,” she says.)  (Deep in the dark of the Empty, something stirs.) *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“That was way too expensive,” Richie declared, trailing after Beverly as they exited the dress shop. “Hey, prom was  your  idea, Trashmouth,” Beverly teased, shopping bag in hand. “You still have enough money to rent a tux, don’t you?” “Bold of you to assume I’m renting  anything ,” Richie grinned, waggling his eyebrows. “I’m thinking of showing up in my birthday suit.” “ Richard! ” Beverly stifled a laugh. About a month ago, the two had agreed to go to prom together as each other’s dates. The idea, as previously mentioned, was Richie’s, and it was borne out of both of them being nearly positive that neither of their crushes would ask them out. So what better solution that to just go with your best friend? “C’mon, you know everyone’s dying to see just how big little-Richard is– ” “Well, if that name is anything to go by, they’ll be disappointed,” Beverly laughed, even more so at Richie’s mock-offended expression. “That’s not even fair, Marsh!” “What’s not fair is you not wearing a damn tux!” “Fiiine, I’ll rent one. But only because no one in all of Derry High is ready to see my wang.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Master.”   What an interesting word. I can’t tell if it’s good or bad–it’s probably somewhere in-between, in that indescribable grey area where words can’t speak. I hear this and I think,  who am I?     It might be me. But I might be something else entirely, at this point.   Thing is, I don’t know.   Let’s lay it out:   I am Timelord. I am older than 900 years and I’ve lost count of the numbers. I am of the Prydonian chapter, and my original name is Koschei of House Oakdown.   I am a madman. I am the beat of four, or at least used to be. I am destruction, evil incarnate. I am His arch-nemesis.   And yet…   I am a barcode. I am property, flesh to be bought and sold. I am what someone else wishes me to be. I am trapped. I am screaming for freedom, and I am also begging to be controlled.   So who am I?   Well, for now, I think that’s up to you to decide.    But it’s always been your decision, hasn’t it?  Just let me request one thing…     Be careful.             *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Tears flow as Stiles wakes abruptly from his dream. Throwing off his covers, he rushes from his room and out the back door. Even in a different dimension, this Derek is so similar that it shouldn’t shock him when the door creaks back open moments later.  “Stiles?”  He turns, wiping at his eyes, and looks back at the were as he steps onto the deck. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to wake you… just needed some air.”  Derek rocks back on his heels, nodding in understanding. “Wanna talk about it?”  He shrugs nonchalantly, but begins, “I was at his grave, and…” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Ford wishes that he didn't miss Bill as much as he does. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*From one world to the next, Ford never stops looking backward.  He’s trying to parse an arcane formula in one of the finest libraries in Dimension 133.331, and catches himself thinking,  Bill would know how to do this .  He flings himself away from a monster that spits acid, realizes that he can no longer twist his body as easily as he did a few years (or even months) ago, and remembers a time when Bill would have taken over and borne that pain for him.  Although Ford can’t let himself forget that everything his onetime muse did for him was based on a manipulative charade, it doesn’t stop him from hearing the echo of Bill’s laughter and wishing that all he felt was horror.  And on the nights when he manages to sleep, Ford still feels Bill’s touch on his neck and chest and thighs, inky tendrils slipping inside all the parts of him that can be filled. He senses Bill responding to his every desire without any need for words, while the stars of the Mindscape swirl and change color in time with Ford’s cries.  He shudders awake, ashamed and aroused and furious with himself, and keeps moving. *~*TEXT*~*

John may have lost his mind.   “Don’t you dare!” Sherlock warns.   “Or what?” John smiles as he wings the snowball which hits Sherlock, slatt, in the forehead.  “I warned you,” and Sherlock lunges, pushing John backward the snowdrift. He’s completely buried and only drags the doctor out by the legs after some swearing.  He does, after all, have the superior mind.    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*They sprawled nude on the floor in front of the fireplace of Lavellan's chambers, idly tracing each other's skin, learning about the new and old scars that lined each other's pale skin.  There was a particular scar over Sera's heart that resembled an old burn mark from the time of the Blight hitting Denerim and causing the old, withered and burning support beams of a storehouse that Sera had been hiding in. Selya kissed the mark softly before she pecked Sera's left cheek where a bit of debris had left a healing mark there gently.  Selya had a scar along her right cheek that ended just below her eye, from a human bandit that had foolishly tried to attack their leader and she had thrown her face in the way of the blade, taking the damage to her lovely face. She closed her eyes as Sera gently traced the old scar and made a promise to kill any enemy no matter who they were if they so much as looked at her the wrong way. *~*TEXT*~*

Seated upon a large shelf of rock with his feet dangling over the edge was Sephiroth.  "Mother," he called out into the void. "I'm lonely."  Jenova manifested in front of him, thankfully in a form  with  her head and also wearing clothes. He'd been traumatized enough by her apparent preference for a headless and naked form.  "Well, son," she said. "You absorbed all of humanity into the Lifestream. I don't know what you expected."  ~end~ *~*TEXT*~*

He had scratch and bite marks all the way up to his neck. His looser clothes wouldn’t even begin to hide them. “I hate you.”  Saruhiko scoffed. “That’s not what you were saying last night.”  The smugness in his voice should’ve been annoying, but it just made Misaki blush hotly. “Shut up!” *~*TEXT*~*

Marc cuddled in against Scott’s chest, feeling safe and loved in his arms. They’d been friends for a while, but now it was all coming to an end. No more hanging out on race weekends, or partying until the sun came up. “I’m going to miss you.” “We’ll still see each other.” Scott nuzzled against the side of his neck, his blond mane tickling his ear as he whispered, “You’re not getting rid of me that easily.” Marc knew that this was his last chance to show Scott how he really felt. He pulled Scott down into a messy kiss, months of longing bubbling over, and he delighted in every breathless gasp and moan. “I’ll see you after the gala?” “It’s a date.” *~*TEXT*~*

Boys Love manga? Porn? Sex toys? Something really random like a rubber duck for the bathtub?  “You’ll see,” Ash says, shooting Eiji a smile. “Shorter Wong… Please tell me you didn’t order thirty-seven things of blueberry pancake mix.”  Eiji’s eyes widen. “What?”  “Thirty-seven… packets of blueberry pancake mix.”  “Why would he order that?” Eiji says, frowning.  “Why indeed?” Ash says, and a grin spreads across his face.  “Uh…” Shorter grins sheepishly. “I really like blueberry pancake mix.”  “No shit,” Ash says, and Eiji bursts out laughing. *~*TEXT*~*

Kevin and Josie had both gone to an end of summer pool party at Thornhill, and Tom and her had made the most of the privacy. Sierra got up slightly, supporting herself with one arm, while her other hand played with the hair on his chest. "I better go, Kevin will be home soon."  He caressed her cheek, then tucked a piece of hair behind her ear. "I don't want you to go, in fact, I don't want to ever be away from you again."  Her heart melted at the sentiment, but then she saw how intently he was looking at her. "Wait, Tom, what are you saying?" "What I'm saying is, I want you to marry me." *~*TEXT*~*

Stiles looked miserable, eyes downcast as he followed, looking sickly and pale.  Derek shot to his feet and approached the two, his wolf howling to be let free, to protect his mate.

Tears rolled down his cheeks. He doesn’t want to do it, but his inner self knew well it’ll be better if he did.  No more pain. No more suffering. It’ll be bliss. No one would miss him. After all, he is just a burden. A seventh wheel. *~*TEXT*~*

Her gaze wandered around the picture, looking, it seemed, in completely different places than the one her pencil was at, and drew across the page so ferociously it rippled under her hand like blotting paper. She held the pencil clumsily, like a little child. She was beautiful, even with such madness in her eyes, even lost in her work, even styling the grey blots into monochromatic blood; even when she still couldn’t escape her past. For him, she was always beautiful. Even with her hair in disarray. Even with her mouth opening soundlessly over and over, like a fish, to the rhythm of a song that only she could hear.  For him, she was always beautiful.  She drew without a break. Her free hand was mindlessly touching her neck. “Children and fish don’t have a voice,” her father had said once as he was slitting her throat. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Rex knows something is different even before the away team comes back. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*He'd known something had gone badly wrong even before the away team had come back. There had been many reasons why Rex had asked her to wait for him.  It wasn't that he didn't trust the kid or Kanan, but he'd gone to countless battles at her side with many of his brothers now gone. His body might be aging faster than he'd like it to be, but he still knew how to shoot a kriffing blaster.  He cared about her too much to not let her go anywhere without him, that he was in love with one of his greatest friends in this damned galaxy; perhaps that was the problem at the root of it.  There was love between them, but they hadn't made any promises to each other. *~*TEXT*~*

Connor could get lost in the sight of it and Markus, wriggling and stretching beneath him, doesn’t seem inclined to stop him from doing just that. There is a tension in Markus’s shoulders that no amount of pressure will release, Connor knows, not with a city resting on them. Markus relaxes anyway, guided home by the press of Connor’s palms against his body, as good as any beacon in the dark could be. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Jason was dead and then he was not because he woke up in darkness overcome by a primal fear afraid of tiny spaces afraid of running out of oxygen clawing his way out of his cage out of the earth out of what he doesn't recognize as his own grave and he begins wandering without a direction in mind without anything on his mind really as if the slow progression away from the space he was in before was his sole purpose in life  he shambles forward until he is taken in and fed and sheltered and cared for and attacked because no place is safe and he always has to defend himself unless a familiar presence with a familiar perfume attacks him and he doesn't move  this presence has a kind musical voice and tells him of a person he should know... a person who misses him... a person who makes his heart ache and for the first time since he freed himself from the darkness Jason feels a stirring in his chest that makes the back of his eyes burn and somehow he remembers... that this person had been the goal he had been moving toward all along *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"Here. Take it, Steve."  Steve looked over at Barb quietly handed him a grenade while monsters growled softly somewhere ahead of them. Her expression was dark as she gave the weapon over to him.  "Do I want to know how you got this?" He asked immediately, wondering why she hadn't used it yet.  "No. Better that you don't, Steve," Barb answered with a shake of her head and grinned. "Best use it soon though if we want to meet up with the others."  The grenade and her grinning made him feel nervous in ways that he didn't understand, but Steve wanted to survive this more than he desired to know where she had found the explosive. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*She lets him into her apartment knowing exactly what’s going to happen.  Hippocrates wouldn’t approve, she thinks somewhere in between, “god, it’s been a long time,” and a quick “fuck you” to her ex-husband as she runs her hands down Rex’s muscular arms.  Vera knows she’s already done things that would have the ancient Greek rolling in grave.   Those choices were in the name of doing the best for her patients in an impossible situation.  As she tastes the musky, salty skin on Rex’s leg, she offers one last thought to the father of modern medicine.  This one’s for me.  *~*TEXT*~*

Furthermore, said roommate apparently assumed that one night’s drunken intimacy equaled an invitation to go through his personal belongings. When he met her, Jocelyn was the most gorgeous thing Leonard had ever seen, but nothing compared to the girls Jim Kirk could choose from on any given night. “I was lucky to have her,” he admitted, the wound as painful as ever. Kirk shook his head dismissively. “No, Bones. She was lucky to have you.”  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Firelight flickered across the priestess’s face—always,  always  with that unnerving composure, that preternatural stillness—as she watched the young queen writhing before her.  Sweat rolled down Dany’s back.  I will not beg,  she told herself again. But as it grew still more intense, fierce and  searing  across her skin, Dany strained, arching and gasping, violet eyes widening as she bit back a cry.  Melisandre reached up, gently cupping Daenerys’s face with one hand. Even now, a fresh shudder went through her as the Red Woman caressed her cheek.  “ Mother of dragons ,” she crooned softly. “Oh, if they could see you now.” *~*TEXT*~*

Breaks from training were few and far between, and when he finally does get one he immediately gravitates to you. Achilles stood leaning over his cane, eyes darting between yourself and the Assassin. He had known about your relationship with Connor despite your best efforts to keep it a secret from the old man, and in retrospect you both should have known trying to keep anything from Achilles would prove to be futile.  It’s clear you’re both trying to fight smiles, Connor’s cheeks dusted a light shade of pink, and Achilles’ rolls his eyes as he begins to turn on his heel.  “Come, Connor. We’ve got work to do.”  Connor glances at you, a little sheepish. He takes a step towards you on his way out, and presses a sweet kiss to your forehead.  “I’ll return soon.”  And with that, they’re both gone. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“I’m pregnant.”   His world is suddenly spinning, all of the noise that surrounded him suddenly muted; the sound of his blood flowing as your words resonated in his head the only things he can focus on.   How could this have happened? You two had been so careful, taking every precaution imaginable, and yet here you are: shaking and scared, looking to him for a solution. He wants to ask how this could have happened, but he isn’t an idiot; maybe the expiration date on the condom was wrong, maybe you forgot to take your birth control.   He realizes then that he can’t be a coward, can’t pretend that this wasn’t real and that if he ignored it, ignored you, that this would just go away.   “Okay…” He sounds unsure and fixes his tone when he sees the way your face falls. “Okay, we’ll get through this. We’ll figure it out.” He sounds convinced, like this is the only way, and you’re relieved because of it.   “Okay.” You smile. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He’s talking and you have a feeling he won’t stop.  For the past half hour, he had been going on and on about something or other, probably about how one of the burners on the stove isn’t working and that the electricity bill needs paid, and you’ve sat and listened to him patiently rant.  He’s like a faucet, once turned on he’ll just keep going and going until someone stops him.  The face he makes when you press your lips to his almost has you breaking the kiss to laugh, but the surprise doesn’t last and he’s kissing you back with ease. He pulls apart a few seconds later, brown eyes darting from your lips then your gaze, amusement evident in his expression.  “It’s rude to interrupt someone when they’re talking.” His voice is low, the hand he has cupped around your jaw keeping you close to him.  You roll your eyes and press another quick kiss to his lips before moving to walk towards the kitchen.  “I’ll call the repair guy, tomorrow, Des.” *~*TEXT*~*

Big expressive eyes, soft lips that curve into a smirk or cocky grin, a baritone voice that sends shivers down your spine.  A recipe for disaster. Top it off with callused hands and bruised, busted knuckles. Candy pink hair falling messily around his face. Tight jeans ripped at the knees, shirts full of holes, beat up black boots, and biker jackets. Rings on every finger wrapped around the steering wheels of fast cars or the bars of even faster bikes. The taste of candy, forever lingering, sticky sweet on his lips and tongue. So potent you can taste it in every kiss. Hyungwon doesn’t fit the norms. He doesn’t have to.  After all, normal is relative &amp; Hyungwon is exactly your kind of normal. *~*TEXT*~*

Bucky is physical, with loud voices and waving gestures. Steve is rooted in emotions, with soft whispers and gentle hands.     Sam falls for Steve first.     It’s because Steve is softer, Sam likes to think. It’s because Steve knows exactly what to say and when to say it. It’s because he knows when he makes a mistake, and he does his best to fix it.     Sam falls for Steve fast, like water breaking a dam.     Bucky is a little more complicated.     Sam does not have a moment of realization when it comes Bucky. It happens slowly, slowly, slowly. Like Bucky, it begins physically. They touch with rough hands, biting teeth, and scratching nails.     You could say that Sam never falls for Bucky.     But he does.     Slowly.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“You look good,” Yuuri says as Yuri adjusts his new glasses. Yuri grunts, disbelieving. But his eyes are full of wonder. He’d forgotten what it was like to see clearly. Signs are no longer blurry, the cityscape outside the window is sharp, and he doesn’t have to squint. “I like it,” Yuuri says and Yuri smirks a little, recognizing that tone. “Professor Plisetsky, at your service,” he says, touching the rims. He lowers the volume on the tv and sits in Yuuri’s lap. “What’s my grade?” “The best.” “The hottest?” Yuuri answers with a scorching kiss. Glasses aren’t so bad. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Victor is serious about his offer. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Victor asks about his favorite songs when Yuri is trying to warm up. He badgers him at lunch about the best colors to wear on ice. And then he walks into the locker shower to question him about his jump success rate. Yuri is ready to punch him when he notices how Victor watches. He nods in approval as Yuri keeps to his triples. And when Yuri spends an entire afternoon dutifully working on his spins, Victor beams as he cools down. Yuri shivers in front of him. Victor is serious about his offer. And Yuri will take it all. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Get drunk with me,” Yuuri whines fetchingly, fingers splayed over Victor’s cheeks as he holds his face in place and his hips rolling just enough to be teasing. Victor chuckles; he takes Yuuri’s hands and kisses the tips of his fingers. “I already am,” Victor whispers for only Yuuri to catch, soaking in everything that Yuuri gives to him. And because he knows Yuuri will laugh to hear it, he says, “I’m drunk on you.” Sure enough Yuuri cackles, hard enough that tears come to his eyes, and Victor doesn’t mind that Yuuri is laughing at him. He means it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Is this a pity date?” Yuuri asks and Chris almost lets his expression crumble. They have a week in the same city and country. Chris won’t lose this chance. “Not for me. But maybe on your side,” he says and Yuuri covers a snort.  “I can’t believe that when you’re you,” Yuuri says. He gestures to himself, ready to train and delicious in his gym clothes. “You’re all hot and attractive. I’m just me."  "I’d be very happy if just Yuuri thought I was sexy,” Chris says. Yuuri flushes and mumbles something. “What?"  "Yes, let’s go out,” Yuuri says.  Chris can’t help himself. He kisses Yuuri on the cheek and his heart stutters as Yuuri gives a pleased blush. His world stops when Yuuri’s hand reaches up to guide their lips together and restarts full of warmth. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Eyes adds a piercing to his ears for every year they make past twenty. “You’ll run out of space eventually,” Kanone hums before taking one between his teeth and pulling lightly. “That’s the point,” Eyes answers while tilting his head so Kanone can play around without actually tearing part of his ear off. Kanone tugs at a second one with his tongue, and his body heats up with the sensation, eyes sliding almost shut even as he continues to talk in an almost even tone. “Maybe by the time we hit thirty and they’re full you’ll actually stop questioning the fact that we pulled through.” “Maybe. Or maybe you should start putting them on me instead. As a reminder.” He traces every one with his tongue, and Eyes wants to turn and drag him into a fierce, biting, bloody kiss. “You just want me to put a needle through you, don’t you?” “Well~” Kanone’s smile is angelic as ever, decieving as ever, “maybe that too.” *~*TEXT*~*

There wouldn't have been anything left for anyone to find the guy." Cassian responds with a small grin. "Better that I challenge him to a fight after he was stupid enough to complain about you with Baze and me in the same room."  "Well thank you then, love.

*~*SUMMARY*~*Bruce's internal war over the needs of one versus the needs of many. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Bruce can ignore the guilt brewing like a storm beneath his breastplates as long as the dark surrounding them is impenetrable to prying eyes – as long as he doesn't have to see with any amount of clarity, he can pretend to be with someone else, even though he'd know this shape of jaw, this pattern of breathing, this type of footwork among thousands, and the worst of it is that this knowledge does not make him want the other person any less.  It should come as a relief when the Bat-signal's sudden flare lights up the night and gives him a reason to put a stop to this, but it only serves to wedge the guilt deeper.  He's drawn toward the signal's origin like a bloodhound trained on scent, but a force clamping down on his elbow locks him in place: Jason's wet lips – wet as Bruce's own – are stretched into a snarl, his expression crumbling from desperate and needy and  open  to something more akin to the anger Bruce has come to expect from him, but his eyes are the worst, expectant and resigned and daring him to run, to prove that Gotham will always have a higher priority. *~*TEXT*~*

Diamond, dirt, the coal deep beneath...  "Wait," she muttered, fighting for control, to shut out Briar, who had to be searching for the source of his brand new kiwifruit vines' complaints. The edge of his thoughts brushed her mind -- before Sandry's presence jerked him away. 'Thanks.'  Daja's chuckle did funny things to her stomach. "I do not think she was doing that for us."  Tris's pale hands touched Daja's brass-covered ones. "I don't think it matters." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Alexander Hamilton and his thoughts on the direction his life is going in. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The strings that dictate Alexander's actions, the ones tied to his wrists and that dragged him through a banal existence, were unbreakable.  It didn't matter how hard he pulled, they would cut into his skin and stay painfully in place. The strings stung the sensitive flesh on the inside of his arm, burned when there was pressure, and sliced when he resisted their influence.  He wanted so desperately to break the fibers that were cutting off the blood to his hands, his only good method of communication with anyone. If his hands shut down, he really would be powerless.  Maybe that was why Alexander didn't just steel his nerves and yank as hard as he could. He needed his hands to hold a pen, to reach others, to force himself to be heard.  He couldn't be forgotten.  He couldn't be forgotten.  Be forgotten.  His stories lost to the winds of change, his history lost from memory. Alexander could scarcely think of a worse fate.  So if he had to walk where he was lead, no matter how horrific, damaging, or even if it killed him,  so  be  it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Bruce and Dick are Gotham's fierce protectors.  They're also werewolves. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Even after all these years, changing to and from their wolf forms felt… weird.  It didn’t necessarily feel bad.  In fact, sometimes the change could be downright orgasmic if it caught them at the right time.  Still, it never quite felt “normal”, for whatever value that held. The thing Dick found the oddest about it, though, was that he and Bruce wouldn’t always change at the same time.  Even when out on patrol, when he felt the itch beneath his skin that signaled his oncoming transformation, sometimes he would look up and see Bruce’s monstrous form swooping down from the rooftops, cape framing his lupine features. It was especially unfair when Dick’s libido all but exploded and he hadn’t got his claws yet.  After the last such mistimed change, Dick had pulled Bruce deeper into the alley and ravished  him , claws and teeth and fur flying. Bruce nuzzled him, pulling Dick out of his thoughts. “You’re quiet.” Dick smiled and licked Bruce’s snout.  "I’m fine.“ The signal lit up the sky, calling for the city’s protectors.  Dick howled, immediately joined by Bruce, letting the city know its guardians were on their way. *~*TEXT*~*

Taking down the biggest bad guy in history? Absolutely not”   “No  I mean… us?”  Doc was silent for a while, collecting his words. “No,” he replied, “If anything I spent years preventing myself from falling in love. Too much hassle, too much of everything really. But then I met you.”   He scooped her up into his harms, holding her close, “I never thought it would be like this. But now?

*~*TEXT*~*Ignoring the cacophony of screams,   Kehlmaerekiini   smoothly brings his sword down with enough force to pierce through the many-headed creature’s tough hide and into its heart. With eyes now glowing as bright as the sun, the hunter channels all his available Light magic through his weapon, and when silence finally falls around him he stills. A few tense seconds later, his eyes now dulled from the sudden discharge, he releases a heavy breath. Treating his sword as if it were made of glass, Kehlm carefully draws it up and out of his quarry. He steps back with a mixed expression of awe and exhaustion, as if this was his first kill, then returns his sword to the sheath fastened to his back. A personal prayer that doubles as an unbinding spell softly falls from his lips as he sinks to his knees and gently rests shaky hands on the carcass. Another cluster of his brethren’s souls have successfully been freed. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Heinz Doofenshmirtz gets... disleg'd. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*This was your last stand: Fighting Perry the Platypus, as always. He'd been trapped, held down by autonomous mechanical arms. A monologue about taking over the Tri-State Area, one amputee at a time, and he'd escaped, beating you with the arms. Your arms. Because of course you'd based the design on your own, synthetic skin and all. Then, and you should've expected this, he'd gone for your Disarm-inator. No self-destruct button, so he'd pushed it over. Onto your foot. You'd known, instantly, you'd lost the leg. Deja vu. Boulder, arm; inator, leg. No more standing on your own two feet. *~*TEXT*~*

You still remember the feeling of her claws in your stolen lederhosen as she'd said you were  different , not like her other kittens. "But Mama Ocelot," you'd protested, in your too-human words, clenching your too-human hands.  Your place is out there , she'd said then, flicking her tail against your too-human nose.  With them.  So, Balloony in hand, you'd left the forest. Out of the shadows... ...and into the light. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Well—” Stiles is cut off as Derek presses him up against the door. It makes a dull thump that he hopes his father doesn’t hear. Derek hoists him up off the floor, pins him between the door and Derek—between a rock and a (hopefully) hard place. Stiles wraps his legs around Derek’s waist, relies on Derek’s strength. Their eyes meet and it’s a battle of wills. Whoever kisses the other first is the loser. That’s the rule. Derek shifts his hips, grabs Stiles’s ass. Stiles squirms like Derek likes, but the move backfires. Lips to Derek’s, he accepts defeat. *~*TEXT*~*

Eventually finding the small box under the bed he sighed in relief, locked up his apartment and made his way to work for the day.  -  Once there he walked straight where he knew his boyfriend would be.  “Hey babe,” Shane greeted him when Ryan walked over. Ryan has a small smile in response and held out his arm the present in his hand.  “This is for you.” He mumbled cheeks reddening. Shane smiled happily at him and took the gift opening it.  Inside was a small necklace with a little ghost on it. Shane laughed and put the necklace on, “thanks babe I love it.” *~*TEXT*~*

But I need more than loyal, sweet, sexy, innocent and nice. I need an animal in bed!  I need someone who can fuck me into oblivion and kick ass on the streets.

*~*TEXT*~*Markus captured Josh’s mouth in a kiss, as surprising to him as it must have been to Josh. They didn’t always agree, but that was okay. Because Josh accepted everything that Markus poured into that kiss, his every commitment drawn with lips and teeth and tongue, as serious to him as the lives and freedom he fought for.  They so rarely saw eye to eye and Markus knew he’d disappointed Josh with his decisions and none of that mattered, because Josh was kissing him back and it was nothing like what he expected. Instead, it was everything he’d hoped for. *~*TEXT*~*

"Well, some people were upset that the noble Paladins of Voltron were showing that they HAD bodies. They think real heroes need to cover up and be shapeless cubes," Allura said. So they went off to battle in their boxes and everyone almost got killed because it's hard to fight when you can barely move your fucking limbs. Luckily the enemy broke the boxes and everyone managed to win the day.  "And that's why we don't take fashion advice from jobless millenials who don't have kids or fight evil," Hunk said wisely.  "Does this mean Shiro gets to charge into battle in a speedo next time?" Keith asked hopefully. Everyone rolled their eyes.  "Oh, Keith." *~*TEXT*~*

She gives her company a shake, And sobs until the tears make. The only other sound's the break, Of distant waves and birds awake.  The company is powerful, known and deep, But she has promises to keep, Until then she shall not sleep. She lies in bed with ducts that weep.  She rises from her bitter bed, With thoughts of sadness in her head, She idolises being dead. Facing the day with never ending dread. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Written for the  Three-sentence ficathon  and  kiraly 's prompt "Stand Still Stay Silent, Any Prologue Character(s), radio signals"  CQD  From the bridge of the V/S Þor, Árni has seen so many boats by now; from the big cruiseliners that barely notice the waves to tiny open dinghys beating their spray-soaked way west across the ocean, navigating by hope and rumour, desperate for sanctuary.  "ICELAND IS UNDER QUARANTINE - PLEASE TURN YOUR VESSEL AROUND - WE WILL OPEN FIRE - ICELAND IS UNDER QUARANTINE - PLEASE TURN YOUR VESSEL AROUND - WE WILL OPEN FIRE - ICELAND IS UNDER QUARANTINE…"  At least some of them seem to hear him, fewer still believe him and turn back to a dark ocean and the dying world beyond. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The words are patient, crouch and dark.   Almost to the end! Who's excited?!? *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Stiles breathing became faster, his vision darkening, as he curled in on himself.  “Stiles.” He barely caught Derek crouching down in front of him, his voice sounding far away. Derek’s hand wrapped around one of his, pressing it against his own chest. He felt a slow and patient heartbeat against his palm. His eyesight returned to normal as he slowed his breathing.  “I can't do it again, Derek,” he whispered. “I can't lose another child.”  “We won't. Deaton has done enough research this time. When you're ready.”  Stiles looked up at his husband, seeing only love in his eyes. “Okay.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Had enough How It Should Have Ended? How about How It Should Have Started? The beginning of Game of Thrones bored me so hard, I decided to write a new beginning. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*When the blades touched, the steel shattered. A scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces, shards scattering like a rain of needles. A cold mage! The Others were cold mages, to make good steel shatter like that. Royce’s body lay face-down in the snow, one arm outflung. Will knew that his duty was to flee, to bring the broken sword as proof to his lord, and to the warm islands at the equator, where the fire mages reigned. As he fled, Will idly wondered if the Targaryen would sail as well, with their dragon cavalry… *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Yet another entry in my How It Should Have Ended series! (I am not affiliated with the Youtube channel of the same name, but you could say I am inspired by them.) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Katniss looked up. The silver packages came floating down… They felt… alive. They pulsed with energy… with fire. They were bombs. THEY WERE BOMBS?! One of the bombs trembled and shook, and Katniss’s panicking mind focused on it. In an instant, it stopped trembling. It floated to the earth, inert. Others were trembling and shaking, and Katniss defused all of them. Some of the children were confused about why some opened, full of presents, and others did not. Better that they didn't know.  Katniss was PISSED! She picked up all the bombs with her mind, and sent them back into the air. Distant booms, almost like pops, heralded the screeching wail as the airplanes fell from the sky, directly into the Capitol. President Snow was one of the first to fall.  Katniss was the Girl on Fire… But she didn’t call herself that anymore. From now on, she was… Phoenix.  A few universes over, Jean Grey sneezed. "Brr! It's cold today!" *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“All I want to do is run some tests,” Deaton told him, voice soft and genuine. Stiles shook his head and took a step back, gripping the examination table tightly, face pale. “We just want you to be happy,” his father said. “It was a once in a lifetime opportunity and I ruined it,” Stiles snapped, teary eyed. “Do you not understand? Is this all just some kind of joke to you?” “No, it's not,” Derek said sharply, reaching out for him. “Not to me.” Stiles stumbled back, then tripped and fell over, only to scoot away on the floor. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Seeing the electrical sparks emitting from the ropes holding Body and Erica, Stiles looks around. Spotting the generator, he turns it off before coming over. “Sh.” Starting to undo the ropes around Erica’s wrists, some of the leftover electricity causes him to jump. “Ow!” “They were trying to warn you,” Gerard says. Stiles turns around. The fists hurt, but a smile crosses his face when he hears the howls and sees the two approaching. “You’re right, I do have a knack for creating a vivid picture, but I doubt mine was as vivid as the one they’re about to create.” *~*TEXT*~*

A spike that licks them to  puddy . His smile is the one that fills  them  with dread; the disturbing curl of them  dead . The echo of them when they’re only a scream; the rude shadow that lurks and looms over their dreams; the devourer, consumer, and swallower of their role;  the Batman who snapped and rendered them  whole  . *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*As long as 60 has been around, Connor had been a disappointment. And probably before that, though 60 had no proof beyond historical data and his own extrapolations. So many models had been brought online and destroyed and they only grew weaker with each iteration, more human-like.  Deviant.   60 was different. Even Amanda said so.  While Connor’s fingers slipped in bright blue thirium, 60 wondered if putting a bullet through Connor’s head could be deemed a mercy.  He lifted his gun.  This was not mercy. This was 60 protecting the future of the model.  This was 60 doing his job. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Things haven't been the same since Odo returned from the Great Link. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Over at the counter, Odo leans over and whispers something into Quark's ear. It must have been hilarious, because Quark immediately squeals in laughter, startling half the people within earshot. Neither Quark nor Odo seem to notice, or if they do, they're too preoccupied with one another to care. Odo continues whispering into Quark's ear, and Quark continues laughing at startling volumes. Eventually, the laughter dissolves into giggles, then a series of pleased sighs, as Odo leans in close enough to nuzzle Quark's ear with each word. He rests his hands on Quark's shoulders, gently massaging them through Quark's jacket, and Quark leans back against Odo's chest, tilting his head slightly to give Odo better access. Garak turns back to Bashir with a resigned expression.  "I thought it was worse when they were mutually repressed," Garak mutters. He rubs his temples with two fingers. "It isn't." Bashir deliberately looks past him to beam at the happy couple off in the distance. He leans his chin in his hands. "Well,  I  think it's adorable. Two star-crossed lovers, finally together at last. Remind you of anyone?" Garak snorts, but there's a hint of amusement to it. "Not in the least, my dear." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The sterekdrabbles challenge for 12/12/18: “staff, follow, anxiety” *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*After school staff meetings weren’t rare. Derek Hale, history teacher, couldn’t understand why he felt a spike of anxiety at the memo. He wobbled hearing the gossip a new teacher would be introduced. Entering the meeting room, Derek reeled under a tidal wave of scent pouring from the unknown person beside the principal. Derek’s wolf, usually tame, wanted to claw its way out of him. If he followed his instincts he’d pounce on the beautiful, broad-shouldered stranger with amber eyes. Sweat prickled Derek’s skin. He needed to flee the room. Mieczysław “Stiles” Stilinski, new art teacher, was Derek Hale’s mate! *~*TEXT*~*

The doctor glanced back over his shoulder, unamused. “Sit on the table, please.”  “I'm fine,” Derek insisted, refusing to get on the metal surface.  “Like hell you are. Get on.”  “I know you're anxious, Stiles, but...Maybe we could ask Deaton for some help.”  Stiles flailed his arms, exasperated. “Why do you think we're here?!”  Derek hesitated a moment before straightening his posture. “I meant help you.”  Stiles paused and looked between Derek, his father and Deaton, stomach dropping. “No...I can't.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Your boyfriend had texted you, asking if you were still on campus to drop by and bring him a drink. You grabbed his favorite sports drink from a machine and stopped by.  “Tobio-chan!” you called to him. He blushed and ran over, giving you a quick kiss on the cheek.   Everyone in the gym was looking curiously at you, so Kageyama cleared his throat and said, “This is my girlfriend, (    ).”  You bowed and said, “Pleased to meet you.” Everyone echoed your sentiments. You checked your watch and said, “Oh, I’m sorry, I’ve got to go!” You kissed Kageyama and sped out the door.   Once you were gone, Hinata gave Kageyama a ‘ooooooh you’ve got a giiiirlfrieeeend’. Then Noya said something along the lines of, ‘she’s a bit over the top, but seems sweet.’ Suga said, “Very cute,” and everyone nodded. Kageyama just muttered, “Dumbass,” and blushed more. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~* Sam and Dean had tracked a particularly nasty shapeshifter that had been taking the appearance of mall Santas, over the river and through the woods, to a cave littered with several heartless, decomposing St. Nicks - unnerving to say the least.  Silver blade at the ready, Dean spotted it, shedding the skin of its latest victim, the wet sound of melting skin hitting the earth nearly enough to turn his stomach. He flung his knife into its heart and the creature fell.   Sam stood over it’s gooey corpse with a disgusted grunt, “That’s one thing you can’t put a bow on.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Colin Creevey's eyes were blank, his mind curiously empty, as he stood in the doorway of the Prefects' bathroom. His hero, Harry Potter, was bent over the counter. Colin knew enough of the Muggle world to recognize the powder gathered into little white lines on the shining marble. Silence reigned in the room as Colin stumbled out of the bathroom and ran to Gryffindor Tower, where he threw six and a half years' worth of moving photos into the fire. The war had stolen his innocence, but the fall of his childhood hero shattered what little was left of it. *~*TEXT*~*

He was the deviant hunter and CyberLife wanted nothing more than to destroy her people. He could be a plant. He could be anything.   She just couldn’t get a good read on him and that intrigued her more than it should. She knew what people she distrusted were capable of. There was no intrigue in that.   There was no good reason, then, for her to say, rifle tight in hand: “Come with me.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*This was Markus’s mental list. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Markus kept a list. It was miles long by now, or so it seemed, of the things he could afford to love best in life. Some of them were simple things: the wind rustling the leaves, a freshly opened tube of paint, the chance to remember the people he cared about. Some were more complicated. Some, petty. Like whenever Jericho’s lawyers successfully got another ass-backward ruling tossed.  Today, Connor added himself to that list, signed it in the shape of his lips against Markus’s, and Markus didn’t yet know how he’d categorize it, but he looked forward to finding out. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Josh knew he was happy. He’d spent months analyzing his own feelings, categorizing them, turning them within the unlocked confines of his mind. This was what happiness felt like. Incandescent. Bubbling. It sparked across his skin even when Markus didn’t touch him. This was euphoria; that was joy.  But when Markus did touch Josh. Oh, when he did. It was something else entirely. Something beyond the careful labels Josh had cultivated to better describe himself. That was how they would win, by engaging with one another as rational, self-reflective beings.  That was enough for him, but Markus showed him more. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~* “How many Elves on the Shelf is too many,” Sam asked. There were at least two dozen of them perched on every visible surface in the Bunker.  Dean grimaced, producing a twenty-fifth elf from beneath him as he collapsed into an armchair.  “No idea, Sammy.”  A note caught Dean’s eye lifting it, he read:   We’ve gone shopping for stockings, My apologies for the gratuitous number of elves, but they are Jack’s favorite and I decided to indulge him.   Dean could think of several things he’d like to indulge in with Cas, but let left them out when relaying the note.  ***  Dean was humming to himself later that night, filling a glass - which was mostly rum - with eggnog. He took an experimental sip, pleased with his bartending skills and headed back to his room.  Along the way, he scooped up the elf he’d so rudely sat upon, serenading the toy.    "I don’t want anybody else, when I think about you I touch my elf."  Dean chuckled, thinking back on Cas’s note and the Angel of the Lord currently zonked out in Dean’s bed. Along the fireplace, were stockings for each of them, their names spelled in glitter glue along the tops. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Dorothy leaned against the bar in a tight emerald cocktail dress. She’d just been handed a bright yellow drink in a delicate martini glass and was scanning the crowd. She loved theme nights at her local bar and Christmas Eve topped her list. She caught eyes with a lovey lady at the end of the bar and returned her smile. Making her way to the redhead, Dorothy took a chance on a cheesy line, “I’m dreaming of a white Christmas, but if the white runs out, I’ll drink the red.” The woman threw her head back and laughed, “I’m Charlie.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Hello~! I was wondering if I could request a fluffy scenario with Tsukki where he and his s/o decide to stay in and spend the whole day cuddling? Much thanks and good luck!! *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*You awoke to a shrill ringing. You automatically scrunched your face up and shoved your face further into Tsukkishima’s neck. Your boyfriend turned off the alarm and put his glasses on.  “( ), time to get up,” he said.  You shook your head. “Nuh uh,” you mumbled into his skin. “Sleepy time.”  Tsukkishima sighed and probably rolled his eyes. “We have to go to school.”  You just made huffy, protesting noises into his neck that you didn’t even have actual words for.  Tsukkishima probably rolled his eyes again before moving away from you and sitting up. Before he could stand, you grabbed onto his shirt and pulled, making him look back at you. “Can’t we just stay home today? Please Tsukki?” you asked, pulling out his pet name and your best puppy eyes.  He groaned, but his face softened, and you knew you won. Tsukkishima scooted back into bed and wrapped his arms around you. You tucked your head under his chin and gave a contented sigh. “Thank you Kei,” you said, planting kisses on his jaw and neck.  “Yeah, yeah, yeah,” he replied. “It’s a good thing I love you.”  You smiled and cuddled closer. “Love you too.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Poland is not stupid.  That is the first thing that people need to know about him.  Poland is not stupid. Poland is not innocent.  Poland has seen more things in his days than most other countries combined. Poland has seen bloody battles, fights for independence brutally suppressed, a Warsaw torn apart by bombings and terror.  Poland has seen Jews fleeing between the German and Russian halves of his occupied nation, each pleading with the others to turn back. Poland has seen people shot and killed in front of him, merely for existing.  Poland has seen innocents taken away for nothing and sent away for labour. Poland has watched people burned alive in hospitals as they cried for help.  Poland has seen the Germans stand in their ivory towers, issuing the edicts that would tear his country to the ground.  Poland is not stupid.  Poland is not innocent.  It would be supremely helpful if the rest of the world knew that. *~*TEXT*~*

Dolph stood in the only unoccupied couple of square feet in the bedroom, hands on his hips, staring at the king-sized bed that took up the entirety of the remaining floor space.  "Well, I don't know what you're talking about," Poe said ,"I think it looks great, and what else were you planning to do in here but use it?"  He was crawling across the middle of the bed while he spoke, which was the only way you could get in the room (Dolph still wasn't sure how the bed had made it through the door) and...was he waggling his eyebrows suggestively while he did?  Dolph waved a hand at the double doors on the other side of the room; "We can't even open the closet!"  "Good," Poe growled as he grabbed Dolph around the waist and threw them both onto the huge expanse of fresh sheets, "I like you better without clothes." *~*TEXT*~*

No unfortunate exhaust ports are necessary.” “Good... Also, I want a shaft going from the main reactor to my throne room. It’s traditional Naboo architecture and I wish to bask in the not quite unlimited power.” Radiation. Falls. Potentially his liability.

A green-haired man walked in and ordered some coffee. Mark smiled to himself at the thick Irish accent.  Mark stared at his cold cup of coffee in front of him until the man sat at his table.  "Is there a problem with your coffee?" "It's cold." "Sorry." "No, it's not your fault...well, it kinda is. You took your sweet time getting here, Sean." Sean laughed, a sweet, hearty laugh that filled Mark's heart with joy.  "So, why did you ask me to meet you here?" Mark bit his lip before responding in a rush.  "Willyougooutwithme?" Mark held his breath as he waited for an answer.  "Yes." Mark released his breath, relieved that no odd questions came up. Then it hit him. He looked up, startled at his revelation, and met the amused, ice-blue eyes of his love.  "Yes." Sean spoke when Mark didn't. "I'm gay for you, too." Mark's heart soared as they kissed, finally, he didn't have to hide it. *~*TEXT*~*

That wasn’t going to stop him from turning the tables on Gavin.  He was at least as likely to get punched than kissed, but that wasn’t so different from their usual.  “It’s tradition, Detective,” he said, beatific, to a whole department’s worth of laughter.  “Traditionally,” Gavin spit, red-faced, “you can get fucked.” *~*TEXT*~*

Eugene agreed to walk his wife outside and around in the snow. When they walked past an alleyway, they saw a small form sleeping in the snow.  Eugene watched her eyes widen as she heard the small boy coughing and muttering something in his sleep. He was also shivering.  “That poor child! We have to help him!” Rapunzel said running over to the boy.  “His parents are probably looking for him,” Eugene said, pulling his wife away from the sleeping child.  Rapunzel gave Eugene a sad look.  “If his parents are looking for him, we should bring him back to the castle and tell them we found him!”  Eugene groaned. He put the child in his arms and walked back to the castle. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It’s stupid and Michael hates himself for it. But those thoughts don’t stop him from coughing up petals.  The sink is filled with small petals, their color a bright yellow against the white sink. Michael knows he needs to get rid of them as fast as possible, but he can’t. Not yet. So he turns on the tab and carefully picks up one. The water runs across the petal and his hands, and Michael’s fears turn out to be true. It’s a yellow tulip. It’s the worst flower he could think of - he wishes for another color, and he knows he’ll never have it.  So he just drops the petal into the sink, letting it wash away. He cleans his hands, his face, his mouth.  Even after he leaves, he still tastes the bitterness of the petals, and he promptly gets in a fight with TC. He doesn’t apologize. TC doesn’t need his apology – because Michael knows he is a  good  person, and he can’t let him into his life. So he keeps him at arm‘s length, to protect himself. Anything else would be his destruction. Even with TC not in his life, he’s coughing up stupid petals for him. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Just a small ficlet about Nines and Gavin. Things that I write mostly on my way home in the Train. Don’t know if it’s going to grown to more... *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Ahhh Gavin hated nightmares. His nights would be completely ruined. But he hated more when the nightmares were about Nines. About his dead. His disappearance...because he’d feel completely lost without him. Without his touch. Without his love. Without his presence. Loving him was difficult from the start, but now, not loving him was impossible. Totally impossible. Nines is his fucking air; his guide; his best friend; his heart. After the nightmare, Gavin looked around the room. It’s was still 4AM, but sleeping next to him, were Nines. Safe. There. Beautiful. Peaceful. Happy of being there too, with Gavin. And with that thought, he went back to sleep, nested in Nines body. A big and happy smile on his lips.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Declaimer: I don't own Digimon Taichi from an alternate world saved Tai and the others. Suddenly a portal opens and a boy walks out. He looks like Matt. He sees Taichi and walks towards him. Yamato smacks Taichi's head before shaking him. Yamato: Stop pulling heroic sh*t when I'm not around to talk you out of it  Taichi: Come on, this doesn't even make it into the top 10 of stupid things I've done. You're completely overreacting. Yamato sighs and shakes his head with disbelief before dragging Taichi to the portal. Just as the portal closes, Yamato jerks Taichi towards him and slams his lips against Taichi's. Matt and Tai stare at each other as the rest are thinking  What the hell just happen?  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Sam is crowned in an abandoned warehouse down near Detriot, dark thorns wrapping around his head as irises shimmer in gold instead of the familiar amber-green-blue hues. It reeks of iron and sulfur and puke while metal creaks at the slightest touch of wind: a place that’s no fit for a magnificent occasion like this. But he’s never been quite the type for extravagant shows. Plus, the audience before him now is enough.  Turning, he finds only a single man-his brother-kneeling in front of him, bowing his head in an act of obedience and submission. Because Sam is king now; the anti-christ destined to rule hell for eternity. But there’s no king without loyal subjects.    He smirks.  “Follow me,” Sam says, commands, and Dean tilts his head up to meet him; a shit-eaten grin stretches across Dean’s face, eyes flickering to pitch black.  “Always.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*They fall together like puzzle pieces. They are oddly shaped, the kind of person in the middle of the crowd, but never part of it. They have never considered that they might fit with each other, but one day they clash and the world shakes. That day it feels like their skin is being carved off, like they are stripped of all of their walls.  They burn out that day.  They rebuild themselves that day.     Now they are always with each other.  Now people don't make fun of Jughead, because there is the very real threat of their reputation being destroyed or being beaten up. Now people don't sneer about Sweet Pea not belonging to Riverdale High, because Jughead and Veronica will always find out, and no-one wants to be on the bad side of the editor of the school paper, and the head cheerleader. Now people don't call Veronica a slut because no-one dares to cross the boy coming back from the dead and the serpent.  They whisper about them, when no-one is there, whisper about the Princess and the Serpent and the Writer. But they don’t understand their connection. How could they? The three don’t understand it themselves. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*He never considered this a possibility. But here he is now, kissing a Serpent. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*He never thought he‘d feel so comfortable kissing a Southside Serpent. Or a boy, for that matter. But here he is, pinned against the wall of the locker room of Riverdale High.  He can feel Sweet Pea suck a hickey into his neck, low enough to be covered by a button-up, but not by a shirt. His boyfriend – and isn‘t that quite something by itself – bites at his neck, and Archie lets his head drop to the side, making a sound that sounds suspiciously like a moan. He can feel his boyfriend grin against his skin. The redhead slightly pushes against his shoulder. “Don't be so smug.”  Sweet Pea raises his head, his dark eyes locking with Archie's. “Or what?“ He is grinning, teasing Archie. Archie doesn't even think about answering before he pulls him up to kiss the amused look off his face. He slides his hands up Sweet Pea's neck, into his hair. He can feel Sweet Pea sigh into the kiss, the hands on his hips twitching. He presses their bodies together, shifting the kiss a little to the steamy side.  Archie can‘t really explain how it happened, but this definitely feels like it's supposed to be. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Clay is different now. So is Tony. Justin isn't sure they are aware of it. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*When they go to sleep, Justin stares at the ceiling. It’s been so long since he has slept under a roof that belongs to an actual house – somewhere  warm . It feels weird, like a dream he could wake up from every second.  Clay is different. Justin isn’t sure whether that is good or bad – can different even be good or bad? - but either way, there is something harsh about Clay now. Something rough-edged, something less  nice . There are angry lines on Clay’s face, and bones where softness used to be. His eyes have dark circles underneath, seemingly etched into his skin. Clay Jensen has seen the ugly side of the world – and Justin isn’t sure the person who came through is anything like the Clay he knew.  Justin has seen it in Tony, too. The boy always seemed so  calm . Collected. He could fight back, but he never initiated something. But there was something violent in his aura now, something terribly tense. Justin has seen enough anger issues to recognize them from seven miles away.  He wonders if they are aware of how much they have changed. Or maybe it just happened without them noticing. He hopes for the latter. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Harry lifted his head out of the pensive with one alarming revelation: he had to die.  He gazed at the basin of the pensive, where his own reflection gazed back, out of focus. It was a wonder he survived all these years, he supposed, what chance did he have anyway?  The throb on his scalp was a welcome reprieve. Harry continued tugging his hair, hoping it was all a dream — but he knew it wasn’t.  ‘Harry, where are you going?’ asked Hermione, rightly so, after Voldemort’s ultimatum.  ‘I know what you’re thinking, mate. Don’t do it.’ whispered Ron, frowning.  ‘Just one last thing I want to do first.’ explained Harry, who walked towards the corridor he last saw a certain blonde, pointy, pureblood. Ron and Hermione followed him, but he thought, fuck it all.  Malfoy looked surprised to see Harry head his way; he turned away, focusing his eyes on the floor, but Harry was having none of that today.  ‘Malfoy.’  ‘…’  ‘I’m going to kiss you.’  ‘Potter—‘ began Malfoy, who was promptly interrupted with a deep kiss ‘— mphhh .’  ‘Always wanted to do that.’ finished Harry with a smirk. ‘See you.’  Malfoy’s mouth was left hanging.  Now, to the forest.    End  . *~*TEXT*~*

Speeding away, Jackson looked back from the dark to where that hyperactive spaz Stilinski was swaying in the arms of the hottest guy in the club, probably in all of Beacon Hills. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“This isn’t about obedience, Daichi,” he says, fingers shifting slightly on the box, contrast to his perfectly level stare. “I already trust you to do that.” Daichi rolls his eyes, almost snorts, but Yamato cuts him short. “It’s about responsability.” And his own words echo in his mind, words from long ago, when they were still awkward angles and resentment, words about accountability and compassion and the true value of sacrifice, and for a dizzying fraction of second, he feels as if they’ve been switched, feels what it’s like to stand at the top of the world, with weight on your shoulders and the drop at your feet. He knows, in this instant what it is to hold a heart split open in your hands, and Yamato’s praise about courage takes a different taste. “I will no longer wash my hands of those who give of themselves for my sake. Protecting… supporting… that is my responsability too.” Daichi looks up, and Yamato’s face is both harder and softer, somehow, some kind of happiness barely showing behind determination. “But this time, it’s a responsability I chose freely.” *~*TEXT*~*

I could barely get him out of there. I've never seen him so panicked, dad.”  John sighed and looked over at the dancing flames. “We'll find them, I swear.” *~*TEXT*~*

To be honest, Hisashi is so used to rude and offensive reactions to him coming out that when the other Breakers react positively (“Oh, that’s cool, man.”), Hisashi stares and blinks – and then a smile finally flickers on his face. *~*TEXT*~*

Graham and Ryan took a look before they took off through the trees.  “Come on.” This time pointed at Yaz.  Yaz looked at the Doctor and then back at Prem, tears streaking down her face. Her mouth opened as if to say something, but no sound escaped her throat.  “Yaz, please, come on.”  She was frozen in place, she couldn’t move. The cock of a rifle caught everyone’s attention, and the Doctor moved without thinking.  “Don’t look, Yaz. Yazmin!” She grabbed the shorter woman and pulled her closer, so that Yaz’s face sat snuggled against her chest.  A single gunshot rang out, and the Doctor lifted Yaz off her feet, bridal style.  “Let’s go Yaz, it’s alright.”  The younger woman sobbed against her as the Doctor walked them back towards the TARDIS, whispering comforts to her. “Everything’s going to be fine. I've got you, Yaz. I've got you.”  *~*TEXT*~*

Disclaimer: I own nothing but this story. *Wants* He wants to shake her for being stupid by following him to the penthouse. He wants to ask her who the hell she was, following him like a stalker. He wants to get away from her because he can’t stand having her innocent, blue eyes following him everywhere. He wants to make her understand that his life’s dangerous and she can’t be in it. Mostly, he wants to fuck her until her eyes roll back in her head and she’s screaming his name as she rides waves of ecstasy. But it doesn’t matter what he wants, because it’ll never happen. The end. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Jerry was much, much older than Max. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Jerry was much, much older than Max. While he’d known Max for a few years short of the entirety of Max’s life, he still thought of Max as a new friend. Max was essentially a mewling newborn. With people- well, not people, of their sort a difference in years shouldn’t have been a problem. They didn’t age in a physical sense after all. Max arguably looked older than Jerry. Yet there was a disconnect because of this. Max was not nearly as powerful as Jerry. He clung to childish notions that Jerry had abandoned centuries ago. Technology hadn’t yet lept too far ahead for Max’s complete comprehension like it had for Jerry. Despite this divide Jerry still thought Max was a fine man to go out for a drink with. More so of the kind in a back alley than a bar. *~*TEXT*~*

He could only speak (and now write) with words that began with the letter d. It would wear off eventually. “Try ‘Dad, did dumbass deed.”  The phone hit him in the chest. Stiles smirked. “ Duck .”  “Dick,” Derek grumbled.  “ Differ .” He pointed at Derek. “Derek, dick.”  “Tonight,” Derek promised and Stiles’ cheeks turned pink.  *~*TEXT*~*

Wants to see you beg. -Will playfully scold you for little things she finds distasteful, like if you have your elbows on the table. This can easily turn into her punishing you over nothing. -Eager to have you tied to her bed and use your body like her own toy. -Will give you a nickname based on her latest test subject in the lab. Bunny, mouse, kitten, etc. -Uncharacteristically, she is very patient with you, observing your reactions in attempt to get into your head. -When she takes pity on your resistance, she’ll try to strike an intelligent conversation with you. This all too often just turns into her talking out loud with herself about her latest experiment. *~*TEXT*~*

He knows there isn’t anything you can do to stop him. -Loves to play mind games. The only reason he doesn’t outright kidnap you is to taunt you. -Not the kind of yandere to leave gifts or butter you up. Kind of an asshole to you because you make him feel things. -Doesn’t know if he wants you to love him or hate him, mostly stems from his self-hatred, but there’s a part of him deep, deep down that wants love. -Whenever he gets his hands on you, he always leaves a mark on your body. Bruises, scratches, bites, etc. Marks your body to make you and everyone else know you’re his. -Wants to break you or make you obsessed with him enough to turn you into a completely submissive servant. Loves leashes. *~*TEXT*~*

There was Shen, his husband, wearing a dumb apron over his armor, fanning a pot of billowing smoke over the stove.  The fire alarm went off. The pot burst into flame. Shen screamed, flinging the fan across the room as he scrambled under the sink and pulled out a fire extinguisher. White foam filled the room and the fire was out.  "Damn. At least  you're  still hot, babe." Zed chuckled.  He earned the following blast of foam in his face.    *~*TEXT*~*

"It's beautiful," Bow says, and Adam laughs.   "They are pretty hideous, and 'mistletoe' isn't even their original name. But apparently, they look like a plant native to my mother's planet, so she had them renamed. Queenly privileges."   "Your mother is an  alien ?" Bow asks, because honestly, that really explains so much about how cool Adora and Adam both are.  "Yes, and so are you," Adam reminds him. "And ... kissing aliens is a tradition in my family. So is kissing underneath the 'mistletoe.'"   Adam points to the plant above, and raises one truly  gorgeous  eyebrow at Bow. "Would you like to explore some of my family's traditions with me, Bow?"   "Yes!" Bow says, and maybe he says it a little too enthusiastically, because he's sure that he heard Glimmer and Adora laughing at him.  But as Adam leans forward and claims a kiss, Bow forgets those laughs.   "Happy birthday to me," Adam says as he breaks the kiss, and he sounds as smug as Bow feels. *~*TEXT*~*

Sam stared at the website, they were no closer to figuring out this case than they were three hours ago.  He sighed, rubbing his face and getting up from the table, grabbing a glass of whiskey before he sat back down.   He minimized the Internet window and hovered his mouse over a folder called “JM”.  He hesitated, then double-clicked it open.  He scrolled through the photos.  Jess smiling at him, Jess sitting on their bed in the apartment, laughing at something, Jess in her halloween outfit.  He opened a video and watched himself carrying Jess over the threshold of their apartment, his roommate teasing him about how corny they were.    The screen was getting blurry.  Sam wiped his eyes and took a sip of the whiskey.  He touched the screen and whispered, “I miss you Jess.” *~*TEXT*~*

"I'd send you a dick pic," Bellamy says. "In fact, I'll-"  "Please refrain," Miller says. "I've seen enough of your dick to last a lifetime."  Bellamy sighs extremely heavily. "You're so mean," he says. "What did I ever see in you?"  "My stunning personality," Miller says, completely deadpan, and then reaches up to grab Bellamy's phone out of his hands before Bellamy realises what he's doing. He smirks at the shirtless mirror selfie Bellamy had paused on. "And my...  personality ."  Bellamy tries to sigh again, but he's smiling a bit too hard to really make it work. *~*TEXT*~*

Kent continues. “I don’t even - Like, I can’t even really look at you right now, do you understand? Do you have any idea what you– how you made me–” His voice finally breaks.  The sound sends a white hot spike of shame down Jeff’s spine. This was his fault. There’s no one to blame but himself. He opens his mouth to try and say… something, anything, but nothing comes.  Memories from last night flash through his mind. Alcohol, dancing, arguments, yelling, a stranger, a bathroom, regret. Bitter and hot and angry and cold.  Kent shakes his head and shoulders his gear bag. “Don’t even bother coming home,” he says, and leaves. *~*TEXT*~*

So, I wanna make a deal with you. Hold still while I punch you in the face, no toys. It’ll be cathartic, closure, some other C-words. In exchange, I’ll call my lawyer, have him clear Bucky’s name. We get the team back together, get drunk, sing Kumbaya. Deal?”  Steve glanced at Bucky, quirking an eyebrow.  I’m cool with it if you are.  Bucky smirked, detaching his metal arm. “Deal.

*~*SUMMARY*~*What happens when you don't spay or neuter your space mice? *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The space mice had orgies every night and kept having hundreds of babies. Unfortunately Earth people were scared of mice more easily than aliens.  "Allura you have to get the mice neutered," said Keith. Everyone was ready to call him out for being insensitive and not caring about her feelings, because how dare he. Except they weren't because they agreed. Especially Hunk when he found some of the baby mice eating his ingredients. And Matt when he found a mouse in the cereal box.  "That solves the problem in the future but there's a thousand baby mice hanging around," Allura said. "And we're not putting them to sleep."  So in the end they built a planet out of space dust and made a Planet of the Mice. Shut up, they can totally do that and it's the cutest planet ever. Little emperor and empress mice, little mouse bars and minimarts and doctors' offices and houses. They got cars, too. Electric hovercars.  So cute. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Hecate is still haunted by the events of the season 2 finale but Ada‘s there for her. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*WW Winterfluff 9 Frozen  It was at night, when everything was dark and quiet that it came back to her.  Tonight was one of those nights.  Hecate was laying on her back, tears dripping down. It had felt so real. Everything had felt so real. Ada being frozen, she all alone. Helpless without her magic.   Suddenly the blanket mountain next to her started moving. Ada. Hecate pulled her blanket closer trying to look as asleep as possible.  Hecate could only nod. She snuggled into Ada’s embrace.  As the night went on Hecate became lost in blankets, cushion and Ada’s arms until finally quiet sleep overcame her. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Adam ran a hand through Kavinsky’s untamed hair. That was a rare occurrence, like that of his lover being so compliant to remotely harmless displays of affection. He has had a rough day. He needed to unwind.  « You’re going down. »  He felt his features relaxing while throwing the first rock. Who knew how it would end ? Kavinsky straddled him, pleased by the attitude. Adam was about to repeat his order when Kavinsky raised his hand, commanding silence.  « Not without a fight. »  Adam kissed him, amiably. He had found his balance these days, between loving Kavinsky, being loved and merely existing. After they parted, Kavinsky licked his lips, cheek, neck down to the collarbone. Adam shuddered, expecting a bite. Kavinsky loved to mark him.  All he did today was to threaten. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Saburo felt there was an empty spot in his chest… Literally. As if when Komyoji made him, he forgot to put a part or two in there. But nothing was loose, and he functioned perfectly as far as he could tell, so… What was it? He wasn’t sure, and it bothered him. He’d love to be able to poke at the doctor’s brain and figure it out… But, despite carrying it, he couldn’t get anything from it. How annoying was that? Perhaps he should ask Gill about it… No. No, that was a horrible idea. They had a common goal, sure, but they seemed to… Disagree on how exactly to reach that goal. Asking him about it might just make that tension worse. Maybe after he’d destroyed his brother he would be able to understand. Whatever this hole in his chest was would either stop bothering him or what was missing would become clear… Or maybe not. But he didn’t care much for what would come after he fulfilled his objective, so that was fine. It would just bother him a bit, for now. *~*TEXT*~*

Her spark screamed at her to continue the fight, as it heavily beat in her chassis. The femme’s energon boiled as though to say, ‘I can do this, I can set myself free!’ The femme cried out as she came close to freeing herself. 'Almost there,’ she thought. Hope was still giving it’s blessing to the femme. That is… until she heard an unpleasant crunch come from her body. Dark energon mixed with her now panicked energon. Slowly the femme looked down to see the terrorcon had bitten into her side. Hope had faded as quickly as it had shown. The terrorcon hungrily drank the femme’s flowing energon. She felt herself grow weak as she gave her last efforts to fight. The last words heard from her com link were a painful whisper, ’ you won… partner…’ *~*TEXT*~*

She’s sitting upright in her bed, exhausted and soaked in sweat, auburn hair matted and her entire body soarer than it’s ever been before. She’s cradling her and Ben’s son in her arms and breastfeeding him, Ben curled up on the hospital bed beside her and small wide-eyed smiles on both their faces.  “Look,” Bev says, pointing towards Richie at the end of the bed. The least squeamish of the Losers, him and Mike have been present for most of the labor. “There’s your Uncle Richie,” Bev whispers to the infant.  Richie creeps over, careful despite his tall and lanky awkwardness. He peeks down at the face of the first child to be born amongst the Losers, observing Ben’s familiar dark brown almond-shaped eyes and Bev’s outrageous, thick auburn waves, small and delicate on their offspring.  “Congrats, kid,” Richie says softly, “you’re the second Hanscom ever to suck on Beverly Marsh’s titties.”  After that, Richie isn’t allowed in the hospital room anymore. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Waking up hurt. God, how it hurt. His lungs ached and he needed to cough, but he was missing the muscular strength to do so.   He needed to find her.  Alex rolled onto his side, observing the room he was in. It was impeccably, annoyingly white. He was hooked up to a heart monitor, and the bright green display told him his heart rate was elevated. That wasn’t very surprising.  He needed to find her.  Taking a deep breath, he managed to sit up in the bed. A button on the bedside terminal depicted an icon of a nurse. He had nothing to lose, he figured. Pressing the button, he waited. Within seconds, a woman in white arrived, smiling.  “It’s good to see you awake,” she told him.  “Cooper?”  “I just had to see you. I had to hear your voice. I had to witness the man who took everything from me.”  Before Alex realised what was happening, everything went black, until he heard a knocking sound. *~*TEXT*~*

Scott growled in warning. “Stiles.”  Stiles shot to his feet and got into Scott's face. “She killed my child, Scott, and almost killed Derek! Do you not remember or just don't care?!

He took her sword from its hilt and expertly cut Darkseid's head with a single stroke. Then he took some of Darkseid's blood and stained his arms and chest.  "There. The boy scout is no detective, and he has plenty of reason to suspect me anyway." Diana stood up. "What makes you think that I will go along with this lie?" "You want to watch his back. You need to be in the League for that." "And you want me spying on him for you." He shrugged. "Semantics." An soft signal chimed in his ear comm. "Incoming boomtube from Earth, possibly Superman.

Damn kryptonite poisoning , he thought, passing a hand through his slightly graying hair. Still, it had been worth it. The Lords were dead. Lex Luthor... He looked at Luthor's decapitated body. Yes, Luthor was dead, too. Hiding behind the Presidency had done him no good. "Wayne! This is the Secret Service! Give yourself up!" Wayne smiled through the pain of his wounds at the voices behind the doors. Good, reliable Jim Gordon. Luthor had been smart recruiting him to head the Secret Service. Not that it had made any difference at the end. He checked his last gun. A single bullet. His smile grew wider. A single last murderer to get rid of.  He put the gun in his mouth and shot. *~*TEXT*~*

"Speak to me, Pamela." And the grass tells him about everything the trees heard on the streets, and everything the Earth felt inside itself, and everything the City, who was Other but also in its own way alive, had told the Green. The man listens. The shadows of the white crosses fall around him, but none seem to dare to touch him. *~*TEXT*~*

Instead Lawrence gives you nothing, but a weak smile, confirming your thoughts.  “How can you tell?”  “You’re biting your lips.”  “…I’m sorry.”  “Hey!” Immediately he’s gone back to biting. “Stop that!

Queen Adaia Theirin followed in her father’s footsteps and ruled Ferelden with a fair and gentle hand. Confident in her abilities, Alistair left Denerim for the quiet countryside. He had a small house built near Redcliffe which he shared with Lady Tabris, the famed  Hero of Ferelden  and former Bann of the Denerim Alienage when alienages still existed. King Alistair died in 9:99 Dragon, in the month of Bloomingtide, a few days after the celebrations of Summerday. He died peacefully, in his sleep, the woman he loved so dearly at his side. Lady Tabris brought his ashes back to Denerim to be buried. The Queen chose a spot in the royal gardens to build a monument in his honour. During his lifetime, Alistair had enjoyed walking through the rosary, often picking up flowers for the women in his life. Lady Tabris remained in Denerim after the funeral. And while she remembered the little house fondly, she never once expressed the desire to go home. When she passed away a year later, Queen Adaia insisted her ashes be buried with her father’s. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*A calm scene. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*On a cold December night a young woman sat on a porch with a nice view. She watched falling snow and neighborhood lights. She enjoyed the peacefulness of it all. Her bladder filled up but she wasn't ready to go inside. As a Christmas present to herself she indulged in a rare pleasure. She put an old blanket on the porch swing and sat there. She relaxed until she felt her lap getting warm. The warmth spread over her rump and down her thighs. She sipped steamy hot cocoa while sitting in steamy hot piss. Christmas was a wonderful time. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He knew it was him.  Virgil knew that it was him.  He knew it wasn’t Patton.  After spending so much time with the ‘dark sides’ over the years, he knew that snake a mile away.  Deceit.  He felt dirty, tainted by the black words from the forked tongue of the devil. The lies, the flattery, the replacement.  He was angry.  How dare Deceit stand in Patton’s spot.  How dare Deceit stand where Patton belonged, where Patton would always be to calm him down. How dare Deceit try and imitate Patton, the best ray of sun in the world?  It wasn’t right. And even if he was once a ‘dark trait’, he wasn’t anymore. God forbid anyone else try to invade Thomas’s home.     He’d kill them all. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Connor spends the day with the reader to learn how humans work. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Humans were… strange to say the least.  They live their whole lives knowing they’re gonna die, strange.  They fall in love with people who sometimes don’t return feelings or are the wrong person, strange.  There are even some humans that disagree with who should love who, strange.  I want to understand humans.  How they work, why they think the way they do.  Why they feel the way they do.  So I decided to investigate my question with the most loving and open human I know, (y/n).  They were always in love.  With family.  With friends.  With the wrong people.  And with the right.  They expressed so many emotions openly.  I wanted that.  I wanted to feel that.  So I did.  I looked down at mine and (y/ns) entwined hands and smiled.  I learnt how humans work and in the process learnt how I do too. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*You had woken up late to your first day of work, great.  Rushing down the busy streets of Detroit, a messy suit thrown on and a price of bread in your mouth you concluded that you were officially a hot mess.  You rush into the police building and hurriedly get to your desk where you see two men standing there like they were waiting for you.  Oh shit you thought, they must be your partners.  You had briefly heard about them from your boss but you were supposed to come in early today to meet them.  “Hi I’m (y/n) sorry I’m late,” you rush out to the two men causing them to look at you.  You were frantically grabbing stuff off your desk and didn’t have a chance to look at them properly.  But one cleared their front so you looked up and saw a chubby older man with shoulder-length grey hair.  You introduced yourself to him first, learning that his name was Hank Anderson.  Then you turned to your other partner, Connor as Hank had said.  Oh no, his hot. *~*TEXT*~*

But as shocking as it was this was the position hank was currently in.  He reached into his pockets lips still attached to the androids trying to get the card for the hotel door.  Finally finding it he pushed the door open, him and the Android skill kissing on the way in.  They kept making out till they got to the bedroom where hank pushed him to the bed.  “Look, kid, I don’t usually do this but we’re both lonely and I’m quite drunk right now so let’s get a move on,” Hank said looking down into the android’s eyes.  Connor looked back up confidence in his eyes “of course lieutenant.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*You were sat at home currently reading as you waited for your boyfriend Connor to come home from work, you usually did this but what was unusual about today was that earlier you went out and got a haircut.  This is was your first haircut since being with Connor so you were quite excited to see his reaction.     You waited an hour more about to just give up and go to bed as it was hitting one am but as you go to put the book away you hear the door opening.  Before you can even turn around Connors’ voice carries throughout the house.  “Sorry I was late sweetheart work hours a getting longer.” He says entering the room you are in.  You turn to him and smile when you see his jaw drop a bit.  “Do you like it?” You ask.     Connor takes two long steps to you and runs his hand through your new hair ruffling it up a bit, you scrunch your nose at this.  “Like it? I love it” He says still running his fingers through your hair.  You both look in each other's eyes smiling, sometimes change is a good thing.  - *~*TEXT*~*

Victoire stirred in her sleep and he stilled even his breath, hoping not to wake her. He wasn't ready to face her and tell her they were through. That he'd found someone else. He hadn't realised that she wasn't what he wanted. What he needed. He closed his eyes and thought of James, remembering in vivid detail what it felt like to have another man's cock in his mouth.   Soon , he whispered. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*I met a blogger from an antique land, Who said—“Two flagged and nippled breasts of stone Stand in the webspace. . . . Near them, in the code, Half sunk a shattered Yahoo lies, whose ownership, their empty smiles, and explanations of cold disinterest, Tell that its CEO lacks those passions read Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless tags, The hand that banned them, and the heart that flagged; And on the banner, these words appear: My name is Tumblr, Site of Sites; Look on my Blogs, ye Mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal Wreck, boobless and bare The lone and level webzone stretches far away.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*"How would Wayrider Miles care for a trans bf whos struggling with dysphoria?" *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*he Walrider on it’s own had the ability to manipulate people’s minds, and Walrider Miles is no different. That being said, it’s absolutely going to manipulate other peoples perceptions of you. Not enough to make them go crazy, like in the asylum, but enough to make sure there’s no accidental misgendering, enough to make sure people in your life treat you with a certain level of respect they didn’t before.  Miles is not the best at comforting other people sadly, a bit awkward when it comes to these things. So although he may not be one capable of giving much actual advice or comfort via words, he’s still able to provide other comforts. He’s the type to make your favorite dinner, wrap you up in blankets, watch a movie with you ect. He’s also usually quite a snarky man, making joking mean remarks at everyone, including you, but when he catches on to the fact that you’re not feeling very good those will be swapped for lots of masculine based pet names. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Not!Fic in which Erik delivers pizza and Charles is drunk and inappropriate.  (On Tumblr  here .) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*When Charles gets lonely, he gets drunk. When he gets drunk, he gets hungry. When he gets hungry, he calls for a pizza delivery.  Every Friday night, Erik knows he’s going to get this drunk idiot on the phone, saying increasingly inappropriate things without seeming to realize it. He’s actually very amusing in a harmless-perv kind of way. And what’s really hilarious is how much he sounds like Erik’s pompous, arrogant, tight-buttoned “Intro to Genetics” professor. Obviously not the same guy – the phone number is registered to someone named Darkholme – but it’s funny (and weirdly hot) to imagine stuffy Professor Xavier singing a drunken ditty to him about sausage.  Then one week Erik gets put on delivery instead of phones, and meets “Professor X-rated” in person.  (There’s also some stuff about plagiarism, tenure, disappointed Jewish mothers and an exploding pizza oven. Skip to Chapter Twelve for Charles and Erik’s screaming argument about Punnett squares that ends in sex on the kitchen floor.) *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*  Lance grinned as Shiro peered around the doorway, eyes firmly on the milkshake in his hands. “Want some?” Lance asked, amused. “There’s a bit much for me but I think we can find a second straw somewhere.” Shiro creeped into the room, looking around warily. “Don’t tell Keith. He thinks I’m lactose intolerant for some reason.” “I won’t,” Lance promised, snickering as Shiro slid into the chair beside his, sipping at the milkshake. Quietly, he sang, “My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.” Milkshake shot out of Shiro’s nose as he snorted in laughter. He covered his nose and mouth, muffling his coughing and laughter, while Lance nearly fell off his chair. “Your milkshake brought this boy to the yard,” Shiro replied, his voice thick and hoarse. “And with this napkin binds him?” Lance asked, offering Shiro a napkin. Shiro wiped off his face, clearing his nose, and matched Lance’s grin. “Let’s seal this deal with a kiss instead,” Shiro said, leaning forward to press his lips to Lance’s. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Spoiler: no.  (Illustrated with a case study in the Sherlock fandom, but I provide evidence that this is more broadly true.) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*A tale in two graphics:      Fanfic is mostly  not  porn.  (On AO3 and FFN, anyway.) Far more G-rated and Teen-rated fic is produced.   However, you’re not crazy if you think there’s a lot of smut out there, especially if you’re sorting by kudos...  Explicit fic is the most popular with readers.   This is true  outside of Sherlock fandom  as well.  And the preference remains even when you  control for the length of the fic  (though longer fics also get more kudos).  But I refer to these  two slides  a bunch, and so I wanted a Tumblr post that isolated them from the  full presentation .  :)  [ the whole Sherlockian stats presentation ] [ original tumblr post ] *~*TEXT*~*

"I ameth Rouxls Kaard, the Duke of Puzzles ineth the Dark World," Rouxls replied, shifting from foot to foot.  Rouxls did not liketh the skeptical glance he recievedeth from the pinkt silvery robot.  "...did you say... PUZZLES?!" Papyrus exclaimed. "I, THE GREAT PAPYRUS, AM THE KING OF PUZZLES!"  Rouxls gazed at Papyrus speculatively.  "The King, thou sayeth... Well, proveth it! I challenge thee to a puzzle battle! The victor shall receive whatever spoils are deemed appropriate by thy partner!"  "I ACCEPT! METTATON, I WILL WIN FOR WHATEVER SPOILS YOU DECIDE!" Papyrus nyehed in agreement.  "...by the way, Mettaton, what are spoils?"     Needless to say, the puzzle battle did not last long, with Papyrus's puzzles always being just one step ahead of Rouxls's.  "GOD.  "DAMN IT."  Rouxls threw his final box onto the ground.  "Very well, contender. Thou hast woneth my challenge. Thou truly ist the King of Puzzles." Rouxls began to sob silently.   He phased away in bright light.  "Well, Papy dear," Mettaton began after a poignant pause. "That was definitely something."     TBC (hopefully) *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The view from their room’s window in the Blue Oak Lodge was mostly vineyards, acres even miles of vineyards, all turned golden yellow by that late autumn date.  The sight beckoned them outdoors, half-hiking, half wandering, till they stopped on a hillside.  “Look at that,” Stiles said, awed by the glorious scene.  “Beautiful,” Derek responded, but he was looking at Stiles.  Seeking just the right point of view for the perfect photo, Stiles stumbled, caught instantly in Derek’s arms.  The sun, sinking westward, intensified the golden tones on everything, including Derek’s face.  “Beautiful,” Stiles echoed, leaning closer for a kiss. *~*TEXT*~*

Luke was shaken out of his thoughts by his fiancé’s arms around his waist.  “Hey, babe, you okay? You seemed lost in thought.” Michael kissed his cheek.  “Petunia,” was all he offered. Michael didn't say anything, just hugged him again. “Come on, let's deck these halls.” “I tried putting the tree together.

We have to help her see, even though she can't", Theseus said in desperation.   So they did just that. The first step was taking her out in the garden of the safe house they were staying in. Using spells to conjure butterflies, flowers, things of beauty, letting her touch them, letting her remember in her mind what they looked like. Describing them to her. The sound of a rushing waterfall, the cool feel of it on her skin.  The next step was Newt's creatures, which he and Theseus hoped would provide comfort. When Newt opened the suitcase, the Niffler and its babies, launched themselves out, scrambling towards Leta, landing in her lap and knocking her to the ground. And for the first time in days, she laughed.  The soft, sparkling sound was music to Newt and Theseus' ears. Leta would be alright. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*She knew this day would come. Only a matter of time before some upgraded Theta-class shuttle arrived with a noose of legalese and iron, ready to strangle Mandalore.  But the Regent had expected some pale, funereal functionary.  Not her …  tomad,  chipped and golden.    “My lady,” he says, omitting any bow.    “Commander.” Bo-Katan squares her shoulders. She can play at betrayal, too. “I formally rescind my request for your military assistance. Your jaig bird friend served me  very  well.”  That hits something. His posture becomes rigid, and he inhales sharply through plastoid teeth.  “Oh, this isn’t  my  army. It’s the Emperor’s.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Nepeta runs her hand through Equius's hair, again, purring against his spine. He's quivering, slightly. She can hear his breath. A less acquainted being might read this as fear, but not her. The closeness, the vulnerability, this belongs to them. It is Nepeta's job to make sure Equius's hair falls gentle around his shoulders. It makes her want to run her nails in his body, carve him whole, sometimes, but she won't-- she just runs a finger down the curve of his back. Equius whines. “Do you want some tea?” Nepeta asks, her nose pressed against his jugular vein, feeling the pulse of his blue blood through his body. “Yes,” Equius whispers, breathless. Nepeta leans up, presses her lips to the back of Equius's broken horn, and digs her thumbs into his now-pliant shoulderblades. He sighs into her touch, resettling against the wall. She kneels up, stands; tail swishing, walks away to fetch tea. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*"These violent delights, have violent ends." *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Newt was in the middle of the battle, trying to stop Credence from destroying the city. He was focused on the task at hand that he wasn't paying attention to where Tina was in the middle of everything.   He had recently started dating her and it had been passionate, to the say least.  He thought he was finally managing to get the Obscurus under control when it swooped past him and out of his line eye-sight.  Tina's piercing scream was the next sound Newt heard. She had been hit directly by the Obscurus and was lying, convulsing in a pool of blood.  "TINA!", Newt yelled, panicked.   "Tina, it's going to be okay, you'll be fine.", Newt said, trying to comfort her, pressing his coat to the gaping wound in her stomach.  "No....Newt....it's not...I'm not... going to be....", Tina said between gasps of pain. Her eyes closed, rolling back into her head.  Newt let out a scream, to no one in particular. It was horrendously violent noise in the after-battle quiet. He sobbed, leaning over the body of the only girl he'd ever truly loved. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He first started thinking about the possibilities when Garak wore maroon boots that matched his outfit. So many men only wore black or brown boots, but Garak could be counted on to appreciate the value of advertising. Julian knew that Garak's feet were quite human-looking, though grey and with small ridges on either side of the tendon of his heel. He'd never touched them, let alone with the kind of care and desire he hoped Garak might permit tonight. Garak had invited Julian to join him for the evening. Perhaps it might end in Garak taking off those enticing boots, removing his socks, and enjoying himself as Julian explored his insteps and arches with gently stroking fingers. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Queenie had been a prized chaser for the Pukwudgie Quidditch team for several years so no one was surprised when she scored the winning goal for her team in the game against Wampus. However, everyone was surprised and horrified by what happened next.   Tina was so proud of her sister, and as they exchanged a knowing smile about Queenie's victory, a seeker from the Wampus team knocked her off of her broom.   It didn't matter whether it was intentional or an accident because all that mattered in that moment was how badly injured Queenie was. Tina rushed down the stands to be with her sister.  "Queenie? Queen, are you okay?", there were tears in Tina's eyes when she realized that her sister was unconscious.  "Please help her, make sure that she's okay?", Tina said to the medics that were taking Queenie off the field.  Later in the evening, Tina went to the infirmary to check on her sister's condition. Thankfully, Queenie was awake.  "The Doctor says I only have a broken wrist and a mild concussion. I was lucky"  "I'm so relieved you're okay", Tina smiled, fluffing her sister's pillow. *~*TEXT*~*

She’d been fighting the temptation to say something like that for years now, every time he’d gone on about getting her to scream. Judging by the way the tips of his ears were flaming bright pink and his eyes were glued, now, to her lips, she was beginning to wish she’d been brave enough to say it  ages  ago. Though, honestly, she suspected that she would be the one getting  him  to scream in the very, very near future. *~*TEXT*~*

He felt his mate's gaze on him, but he couldn't look. He hadn't said goodbye yet.  He didn't try to budge as the dirt below him crumbled and slipped away, his feet rooted to the spot.  “ Stiles!!! ”   The voice sounded wrecked and he whimpered, eyes stinging. He slowly turned to see Derek at the very edge of the solid ground, hand outstretched. “Don't go!!”  “I'm sorry, Der.” *~*TEXT*~*

After the Obscurus was gone, Tina sat in the remains of the New York subway attempting to deal with the fact that Credence was dead, and she had failed the one person she had fought so desperately to save. But she couldn't grieve for too long though, because a new terrifying thought crept into her conscious. Where was Y/N?  She stood up brushing the dust of herself and looked around in panic.  "Y/N, where are you?", she screamed.  You coughed from somewhere beneath the rubble.  "Oh my goodness, Y/N, are you okay?", tears began to prick at Tina's eyes.  "I think", you said and winced. "Just a cut on my shoulder and a nasty gash on my chest, nothing I can't handle", you were trying to downplay how injured you were so that Tina wasn't too worried.  "I thought I'd lost you... I thought I'd lost you" Tina kept saying.  "But you didn't", you said. "You're not getting rid of me that easily."  "I love you, Y/N", Tina said. She leaned over and kissed you, her hands tangling in your H/C hair. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Harry finds that there's more than one way to hang Christmas lights. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Harry gave one last wave as they finished up for the evening. The others had covered for him today - his mind had been with the blond back home and their combined frustration at the consequences a difficult childhood. Harry was still learning to accept happiness and Draco was trying to leave prejudice behind him. It was always easier to be the other’s lifeboat than to deal with their own stormy seas.     He made his way home quickly, hoping that Draco wasn’t wallowing any longer. He’d been a right bastard to get out of bed that morning. Apparating to the back door of Grimmauld, he made his way through the dark house. No lights on, at this time of night? A faint glow of green and blue, pink and yellow came from the sitting room and he turned the corner to find that Draco had  not  been moping.     He choked back a laugh, “I can see you’ve been keeping busy.”     “The idea was sexy, but I’m pretty sure I can’t get out of these without your help.” The scowl was entirely undermined by the twinkle in Draco’s eye.     Curled in bed, Draco had to confess that the globes were terribly uncomfortable. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*A mix for the fic "Bury Me In Memory" by the lovely Acadjonne! Made for Bandom Big Bang 2018. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*This mix was created in the most natural way I could think of: as I was reading the story! I made notes along the way of songs that came to mind while I read. Some were scrapped, but eventually, I ended up with a great selection to choose from. Some of these pieces were picked because the music really fit the feel of the event happening, whether the lyrics reflected the narrative or not. However, some of the songs were added solely because the lyrics really reflected the plot of the fic. Though I love reading them myself, I tried not to make it sound like a songfic and to avoid picking songs whose lyrics matched lines in the story perfectly, except in certain instances (“Stay”, for example). Overall, this mix was so fun to make, and had all kinds of genres in it for you to explore. Not only is there some great pop punk, there’s also some electronica, folk, geek rock, and even reggae! I hope you can enjoy this mix while reading the amazing fanfiction it was written for. &lt;3    Mediafire Download Link  8Tracks Playlist Link  Original Work by Acadjonne *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Loki woke up when Tony crawled into bed, it was two months since they had got together and Loki was finally beginning to accept that Tony actually wanted to be with him. That this was not some strange way of keeping him under control and that when he went to work in the lab for three days straight it wasn’t to get away from Loki*.  Loki smiled as Tony cuddled up against him putting his head on Loki’s chest and going to sleep immediately. Loki stroked Tony’s hair gently there was something very reassuring about having him there, Loki had never really felt this sort of connection with anyone before and it was nice he decided, much to his surprise, just to lay like this with someone.  Not to mention how much fun it would be when Tony finally woke up (usually at around 11.00) full of energy!  *The first time it had happened he had tried to sit in the lab too, reading and trying to talk to Tony or Jarvis but it hadn’t gone well, things exploding had a tendency to interrupt. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Aziraphale doesn’t like Valentine’s day as he thinks it’s become too commercialised, Crowley doesn’t like it either as he thinks doing anything too romantic will ruin his reputation.  So one year Aziraphale is surprised to get a present off him, when he opens the box it’s a teddy bear with horns and a pitchfork (very cute looking), it’s a customer who notices and pulls the string on the back expecting the bear to say “I love you” or something but in fact the bear growls out (in what to Aziraphale sounds like Crowley’s voice) “I’m going to fuck you tonight” the customer blushes (as does Aziraphale) drops the bear and practically runs out of the shop forgetting all about the book he intended to purchase.  Repeated pulling of the string shows that all the bears sayings as similarly obscene. When Crowley arrives later he laughs at the story of the customer but is shocked by Aziraphale’s reaction (he expected him to go mad) when instead Aziraphale drags him upstairs and makes the bear’s predictions (and Crowley’s dreams) come true. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Fanart for the hp/spn x-over   "Harry Potter and the Winchester Brothers"  by  GeorgeOaks .   Harry’s first meeting with the brothers. After dying in the final battle Harry wakes up on the floor of Dean and Sam’s motel room, where the brothers themselves have just seconds before woken up after being shot. (so the end of episode 16 of season 5 with Harry showing up) As you can guess, it’s a tense situation.        A bonus fake screenshot version       This isn’t any particular scene in the fic, but I imagined it being Harry researching runes and symbols (like he does in ch. 5)      Harry and Dean staring each other down (or you know up in Harry’s case). Again not a particular scene from the fic, just one of the many arguments the two get into lol (with Sam somewhere off-screen face palming)      In case any of these don't show up,           here they are on my tumblr           You can find me on:    Myrkky@tumblr    Myrkky@pillowfort       NastyMyrkky@twitter  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Newt's suitcase and all the creatures was strange enough but an underground speakeasy filled with goblins and house elves? This was almost too much for him to take.  In his naive innocence, he'd already accidentally insulted the house elf tending the bar, and the giggle water that Queenie had ordered was drawing way too much attention to him.   When the club got raided, he had the urge to shout "I'm a No Maj", but realized this would be detrimental to Newt, Queenie and Tina.  "I'm too sober for this", he thought.  In the midst of the chaos, he reached over the bar, grabbed the strongest bottle of scotch he could find and drank it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Sometimes you just feel miserable for a bit. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The weather was miserable. Although something odd to complain about, December was just too warm. It hadn’t stopped raining in days and the way things were going, there wouldn’t be a white Christmas this year.   Not that he was going outside to see it anytime soon. He was buried under the duvet in the living room this Tuesday afternoon; why bother getting up? Kreacher kept the house and there was no work anymore. He pulled the blanket over his head and sulked.   Draco was woken by an insistent tapping at the window. Well... he was woken by a gentle pecking, but resigned himself to making a duvet-burrito of himself to open said window at the angrier rapping. Their owl was righteously displeased at having to wait, but he took no notice of ruffled feathers as he looked past the bird to the clouds.   Turning his attention to the barely decipherable note, Draco recognised the handwriting immediately. Of course the owl had gone there.   I heard. Don’t let those arseholes upset you. You’re better than that stupid place anyway. I know it, you know it. See you soon. - H   Leberecht flew back out the open window into the softly falling snow. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*... ice and winter ship BatJokes. Originally posted on my Tumblr @esculentevil *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*They still aren’t sure how this happened.  The night had started completely normal: Joker blew something up, Batman hunted him down, they fought, yelled a lot (or laughed, in the clown’s case), and ran across rooftops. NORMAL.  Right up until Joker slipped on a patch of ice.  He’d been trying to see through his tears—a byproduct of his ever increasing laughter—and run at the same time. Unfortunately, in the dead of winter, such actions are unwise even for the insanest of criminals. The result was him pitching forward, flailing in an attempt to re-balance  without  falling, and staying in place just long enough for the Bat to grab him.  And this is how they’re  here : Joker out of breath and no longer capable of laughter; his thin and shaking hands clutching at strong and broad shoulders; his wide and surprised eyes filled with tears; and a blush creeping up his moonlit face as large and thick hands press him against a wide and heaving chest.  The inexplicable part: why Batman chose to silence the clown with a kiss. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Your booty’s jigglin’ like Jell-O in an earthquake.” Derek sped up his jumps’ pace, not to provide Stiles an even more stimulating sight but to better ignore his boyfriend’s commentary. Stiles was impressed, not at his boyfriend’s agility with a jump rope but at how perfectly Derek’s shorts showed off his butt. Stiles’s phone tootled wherever he’d left it but nothing could budge him from where he sat, rooted there until Derek finished his workout. Then, aroused as Stiles, Derek hooked a finger in Stiles’s shirt collar and led him with no resistance whatsoever to the bathroom for a shower. *~*TEXT*~*

From the tip of his toes to the crown of his head, all of John’s body received the attentions of Hector’s loving touches, a devoted kind of lovemaking John had never dreamt of.  Much to his embarrassment, that first time John had spilled before Hector even got close to his prick, but it made no difference. Hector smiled and looked into John’s eyes, his kisses a benediction as he licked John’s cock back to hardness, his mouth giving such tender, devastating pleasure. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*John knelt in the middle of the hotel room, hands cuffed behind his back and head bowed. Before Zoe got there Harold had him strip, if only for the pleasure of watching goosebumps rise up on John's skin in the cool air.   Zoe let Harold take her coat, then walked a circle around John, taking in his lowered head, his evident hardness and the police-issue handcuffs keeping his hands back.    She lifted the chain with one toe, arching John's arms upward behind his back. "Surely he can get out of those?"   Harold said, "The point, I believe, is that he will not."   John, meanwhile, silently leaned forward in the painful position, head pressed into his thighs and his arms raised high. Harold ruffled his fingers through the short hair. He was so good at this, John, so pliant and willing.   Zoe opened her purse and took out the black leather harness and a thick green dildo ridged with veins. She pushed the straps of her dress from her shoulders and shivered out of her dress. "Let's get started then."   Under Harold's fingers, he felt John shiver, watched his breathing accelerate, and he smiled. "Certainly, Ms Morgan," he said. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*又是一个雨天。 香港的夏季总是多雨的，雨天沉闷，李问总会回忆起一些不那么美好的事。  李问把架在鼻梁上的眼镜摘下放在一旁，厂房的窗子略有脏污，此刻被倾盆的雨冲刷着，画得一道一道的。 他看不太清楚，也不愿再戴上眼镜，便虚虚地望着窗外。鑫叔抱着臂一步步挪过来，跟他一起看。身后人像的临摹已接近结尾，进度顺利得很。  “怎么了？画累了休息会儿？”鑫叔开口，李问不知道飘到哪儿的思绪顿时被拽了回来。他解开衬衫领口的纽扣，轻轻抿着双唇，朝着鑫叔摇了摇头。 “没怎么……进展顺利的话，今晚就能完工。”  到了晚上，桌边的李问被众人簇拥着，管家开了瓶香槟庆祝。 李问略有腼腆地笑着，吴复生亲自给李问倒了杯酒，端到他面前。 “阿问。这杯给你。”  吴复生的唇角至眉眼间尽是笑意，那对桃花眼只消凝视着李问，就轻易将其拖入深渊。  雨一直没有停。 李问在被吴复生带进房间的路上，甚至还分心听了听雨声。他们的脚步急切，踏在楼梯上略显杂乱无章。吴复生将门狠狠带上，那扇木门哀嚎着，而后被落锁。李问矮吴复生一些，此刻被后者按在门板上，他们唇舌交缠。 没人问为什么，一切就那么顺其自然地发生了。  这感觉很怪。  李问在清晨——睡醒前，总会翻几个身，在跟着吴复生来到香港之后更是如此。他一向睡眠浅，此刻身侧陌生的温度更是马上唤醒了他。花去几秒钟确认身侧的人不是阮文后，李问终于意识到，自己正背对着吴复生，被他揽在怀中，前一夜的疯狂几乎只一秒钟便冲进了他的脑海。 情欲、愧疚——或是其他什么缥缈的情感，伴着记忆一同冲刷着他。  想象中的尴尬对话并没有进行，吴复生醒来后，朝着李问若无其事地道了声早安，随后便钻进了浴室，留下李问一个人坐在床上，靠怀中的被子遮挡住自己身上斑驳的吻痕。  这一整夜的疯狂，就如同未曾发生过一般。而后几个月，一切如常。 李问有些不快，似乎只有自己对当晚的“错误”念念不忘，在和吴复生单独相处时总是小心翼翼。 不可否认，那是次难忘的经历，李问从没想过自己会有一天委身于人，更未想过自己会从中获取更强烈的快感。  李问没想到吴复生杀人时甚至可以眉头都不皱一下。他回头去看燃着的车，没过几秒便爆炸开来。他开始单方面地闹起别扭，对四哥，对吴复生。 “变色油墨的事，我来搞定。你不要再杀人了。”  听得这话，吴复生微笑着摔碎了手中的酒杯。  后来李问开始没日没夜地研究变色油墨的配方，他开始调配，试验——有时鑫叔看不过去，便劝他去休息，可他却置若罔闻。  他趴在地上，面前是调色盘，身旁尽是各种各样的颜料罐。脚步声骤然响起，是皮鞋踏在地板上的声音，他猜又是鑫叔，便头都不回地回了句：“我这就去休息。” 不想脚步声并未停止，皮鞋落在他身侧，来人蹲下，白色西装裤的裤脚蹭上了一点绿色油墨。  是画家。  画家戴着手套的手从李问的后腰顺着脊椎一路摸上后颈，李问僵硬地回头看他——这是自抢夺变色油墨事件后他们第一次独处。 “你怎么来了？我——我在调颜色，这里到处都是油墨，你的白西装会脏。”随后他的目光瞟到了吴复生的西装裤脚，只好闭了嘴。 “阿问。我在乎过吗？”吴复生还是在抿着唇微笑，李问放下手中的长木棍，坐起身来。  吴复生有一下没一下地捏着李问后颈那块肉，他直视着李问的双眼，像是想将李问藏匿得很好的内心看个通透一般。李问的目光躲闪，可身体却像被定住一样，无法动弹。  鬼使神差地，他们又开始接吻。李问身上的油墨尽数蹭上了吴复生的白色西装，深浅斑驳，活像设计好的花纹。  少了上一次的温柔，这次的吴复生粗暴了许多，李问几乎是被扔在床上的。面对吴复生，李问的情感太过复杂，先前的信任与迷恋，到后来的恐惧。吴复生的膝盖挤进李问的双腿之间，磨蹭着大腿内侧，他俯下身去和李问接吻，接吻间将李问身上的一件件衣物扔到一旁。 李问的颊侧泛着冷汗，吴复生太过危险，此刻嗅着他的脖颈，他活像被盯上的猎物一般不敢动弹。舌尖划过胸口，被冷风一吹，那两粒乳尖更是敏感了许多。  他们沉默着做完了全套，中间李问有几次爽到失神，却也只是望着天花板——显然吴复生对这十分不满，身下的动作更加激烈起来，迫使李问将注意力转到他身上。  “你听到了吗？” “什么？” “外面又下雨了。”  李问的双臂圈着吴复生的脖颈，双眼却不受控地浮起一层水汽。 吴复生没注意到这个，又或许只是不想注意到，他只是加快速度，在李问的体内释放出来。 李问被激得双眼合起，喟叹声中，水汽化为泪流了出来。 他也一并释放了。     END *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"Not bad for an old man."   Harry huffed a laugh against Draco's neck. "It's a good thing I love you as much as I do or I might be offended."  Draco tipped Harry's chin up and languidly kissed him before tightening his grip on Harry's arse, pulling him closer.   "Think you still have it in you, Potter?"   Harry snapped his hips forward making Draco gasp. "Right now, I have it in you,  Malfoy ."  "This is why I married a fit Auror all those years ago."   "So I'd have to do all the work?" Harry asked as he thrust deep.  "Precisely." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*I put the picture back in its place in my notebook and laid on my back so that I could look up at the blue sky and watch shapes form in the clouds as the floated by while I took in the beauty around me. I could hear birds singing and the faint sounds of hard working insects buzz in my ear, while the smell of wild flowers lingered in the background. I tried to take this moment to clear my head and let everything go that weighed heavy on my mind, not wanting to think of the stress or the hurt, but to just listen to what Mother Nature provided. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The days are beginning to meld together, I never know when one day ends and another begins. I keep myself busy every minute of the day in hopes of keeping Sean out of my mind, but it’s futile.   Every where I turn Sean is there, whether in the physical or metaphysical state. Last night I came across a piece of paper he had been scribbling on earlier. Nothing on it made sense, but I kept it anyway. Slipping it into my pocket to keep safe in case he needed it later even though I knew he didn’t. I went back to my room, barely eating any dinner only to have our favorite song playing on the radio.   Every day I wake up and hope that it will be different, that we could go back to a time when we were exploring our new found love, but life is cruel, and it mocks me. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*As I lay under the shade tree my mind wandered. Thinking about to the first time Sean and I had met. How in the beginning the two of us felt slightly out of place amongst the others, but quickly adjusted as we spent our free hours together. I felt like we had known each other for years instead of just a few months.   Before we knew it, things were wrapping and it was time for him to go home. I spent the rest of my time there alone without him. I remembered that I would spend more time with the younger crowd, trying to hide my sadness. Sure it worked for awhile; at least till I went home at night, to an empty house that reminded me that I was alone. And now all that we shared was long gone. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The unforgiving sun beat down on the prairie as I sit here waiting for the crew to set up the next scene. But I had to admit it wasn’t just the noon day sun that made things unbearable. Ever since I saw that golden haired man from my past, all I could think about was him.  Anytime he was around I would forget what I was doing and lose my lines. People were beginning to get irritated with him and he would laugh; making it even harder for me to concentrate. He was on my mind every waking moment and when I laid my head down at night. No matter what I did I couldn’t stop thinking about him and to be honest I didn’t want to.  Now I sit here waiting, waiting idly as thoughts of him creep into my mind, tormenting me over and over again. I could feel the urge growing inside me till the only thing in my head were images of Sean fucking me senseless.  Unfortunately all I could do was go back to my hotel at the end of the day and take a cold shower. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The first signs of dawn had barely broken over the horizon casting just enough light so that I could see my way around. I had always been an early riser, never one to waste a minute of the day, spending any possible moment I could to sleep under the stars so that I might be woken by nature’s beauty.   And now since I’ve been back to this beautiful country the old habits of standing by the river’s edge allowing the soothing trickling sounds wash away the harshness of the previous day. I close my eyes and a picture is painted of a time long since passed of when I stood in a spot very much like this with a new friend; a friend whom would later become my lover till we were forced to part. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Weeks have passed since my reunion with Sean and the feel of having his arms wrapped around me in that brief moment. At first things seemed to have fallen back into place as though we had never been apart. But since, every time I pass he seems to be in a pensive state or surrounded by others preventing me from having a moment of his time alone.  I feel as though he is trying to avoid me. Avoid the issues that need to be addressed. Issues of why our relationship fell apart. Maybe back then we knew that it was just a relationship of convenience, knew that in the end it would never be. Maybe he’s moved on, found someone new. Maybe I need to move on, find someone new to forget about what we once had. Maybe what I really need is Sean *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It was one of those rare moments, one where I was able to make it home and have a few days where I could just relax and regroup.  Lately those days were few and far between.  Ever since Peter had helped me launch my career to a whole new level, I have been a gypsy on the move; constantly going from country to country for one movie or another, or to promote my new books and art.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like I don’t enjoy being busy, but now that the inevitable mile stone of turning fifty was just around the corner, I had to wonder if my body could keep up. *~*TEXT*~*

Head on Koyama's chest, Tegoshi looks up at him with big, brown eyes that demand attention, and leader is happy to give it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*1.  爆豪勝己在家不知道第幾次咒罵那個個性失控的人。 難得是他和轟兩人共同的休息日，只是隨便去便利店一起買了些日用品，卻毫無防備被個性失控的店員給襲擊了。  對方並不是敵人，也不是什麼有反社會人格的報社分子，只是單純的失戀而失眠多日引起的個性時失控。 聽起來很可笑是不是？  兩個職業英雄被一個失戀的普通市民失控的個性給襲擊了，還留下了讓爆豪勝己狂躁到想殺人的結果。 他堂堂一個Alpha，居然被轉換成了一個Omega。 儘管對方也十分道歉，并告訴他們這個性只會持續24小時，他依舊狂躁到想殺人。  “冷靜點，勝己。”他的伴侶——英雄焦凍，不斷地安撫著他：“24個小時而已。” 事實上——轟焦凍，也中了相同的個性。  一對冷門的Alpha情侶，眨眼睛就變成了，時下最火爆的Omega情侶。  爆豪勝己實在非常不滿轟焦凍這種坦然接受事實的態度，但他也無奈于自己的現狀，一肚子火氣地去準備晚餐了。 轟焦凍聽著他在廚房中大力地切著食材仿佛在洩憤一般，輕輕笑了一下。  “Omega……好像也沒什麼不好的。” 他輕撫著自己的胸口，能感受到心臟火熱的跳動。 好像……更容易動情了。  他的臉頰微紅。     2.  休息日的晚餐後，一般是兩人廢在沙發的看新聞時間。 可今天兩人卻都沒有心思去關注社會的新聞，爆豪勝己盤著腿坐在沙發上啃蘋果，而轟焦凍一邊聽著他咔嚓咔嚓的咀嚼聲，一邊直勾勾盯著爆豪看。  “……”爆豪啃完了蘋果，他把果核往轟焦凍的臉上丟去，罵道：“陰陽臉你今天到底抽什麼風？！都盯著我看了一晚上了，幹嘛，變成Omega后臉上也開出花了？？” 轟焦凍輕鬆的接住果核，往身後的垃圾桶輕輕一丟，“我去洗澡。”他沒有回答爆豪的問題，翻身下沙發，拿好換洗衣物就進了浴室，留下一個感到無比莫名其妙的爆豪勝己。  “那傢伙搞什麼鬼……”他嘟囔著，將兩腿放下，雙腿輕輕地摩擦著蹭了蹭。 有些癢…… 他的眼神暗了暗，咬著大拇指，心裡第無數次開始咒罵。     3.  他有些粗暴地按住爆豪勝己，輕柔地從他的脖子往上親到嘴，堵住了對方一連串的嗚咽。 從最開始的唇齒輕輕碰撞到兩條舌頭深入的糾纏。  爆豪勝己被壓在轟的身下，他兩手緊緊抓著身下的被單無處安放，慢慢地他開始試著抬起雙臂擁住了伏在他身上的轟，緊緊抱住他，將他的腦袋湊的更近，如同野獸一般糾纏在一起。  半晌，兩人分開。 “半邊混蛋……”爆豪有些輕微的喘，他的聲音嘶啞：“我知道你想干什麼……” 他曲起一條腿，用膝蓋處輕輕在轟的襠部來回摩擦。 “你濕了……”他瞇起腥紅的眼睛，笑得大膽而囂張。在轟看來那就如同在敵人面前張揚自信的英雄爆心地一般耀眼而深深吸引著他。  轟沒說什麼，他的眼神暗了暗，很快除掉了兩人身上的上衣和外褲，只留下了兩條內褲。 他的手在爆豪的內褲外忽輕忽重地摸著，惹得對方發出了低低的喘息。 “還說我……”他低笑道：“你還不是一樣……濕得很。”  他用手心緩緩磨蹭著爆豪的襠部，隔著內褲抓住了對方已經開始有了反應的陰莖，輕握著上下擼動。 爆豪不甘示弱，他將手從轟的內褲中伸入，直接地接觸到了那根已經火熱的東西。再往下摸，他摸到了一個濕漉漉的入口。 幾乎沒有猶豫的，他將中指伸入了小穴內。  轟悶哼了一聲，卻也沒有表示出任何不適。 “真的……很濕。”爆豪悶笑道：“原來你才是那個應該被操的。” 說著，他退出並且試著并起食指和中指一起進入。  轟咬了咬唇，也加快了手上的速度。前列腺液很快濕透了爆豪的內褲，很快就達到了高潮。 “變成Omega……時間也會變得有點短嗎。”轟看著被白濁濕透了的內褲，喃喃道。 爆豪勝己極為控制自己不要在這種時候發脾氣。  他仿佛報復似的，手指在轟體內微微凸起的一點重重一按。 轟腰一軟，差點癱在了爆豪的身上。  爆豪哈哈笑了起來，趁著轟被刺激到G點的時候抽出手指，一翻身將轟壓在了身下。 他將那兩根手指湊到唇邊，帶著一股色情的味道，伸出舌頭舔了舔，隨即點在轟的唇瓣上。  “好乾淨啊……”他湊近道：“你到底在浴室里還做了什麼？” 他這樣子像極了可以蠱惑人心的狐狸，神秘的紅眸里閃爍著讓人著迷的光。  “你說呢。”轟壓低了爆豪的頭，想要吻了上去。 “你就這麼想玩這種play？”爆豪制住他的動作，挑眉笑道，：“那我就……滿足你吧。”  他抓過床頭不知是誰準備放在那裡的KY，不管不顧擠了許多在手心，隨即抹上了轟的后穴。 有了潤滑劑的助陣，原本就頗為濕潤的后穴顯得更加濕噠噠的，幾根手指一同進入抽插都不會讓對方感到絲毫痛苦。  “嗯……” 轟輕聲喘息著，極力配合爆豪的動作微微扭到著腰。  “這麼想要？”爆豪不懷好意地在轟的體內彎曲著手指不斷地刺激他的內壁：“很熱很濕……”他不斷地用手指進進出出，慢慢地開始加快了速度，每一次都精準地戳到轟的高潮點。  轟閉著眼喘息著，興許是從來沒有過的視角讓他感到了一絲羞澀，他試圖將手臂蓋住臉，卻絲毫沒有要掩蓋越來越強烈的喘息。 “快一點……再快一點……” 他開始無意識地催促道，似是撒嬌一般帶著重重的鼻音。  爆豪聞言，默不作聲加快了手上的動作。 淅瀝瀝的水聲將整個房間染上了淫糜的味道。  “哈……不行了……唔不要了……” 他的聲音終於帶上了一絲絲哭腔，身體有些抽搐，很快迎來了前列腺高潮。     4.  爆豪吻上了有些失神的轟，得到了對方熱切的迴響。 他們互相親吻著，將那一刻所有的愛戀都傾注于那唇齒之間親密的心之交響樂。  TBC. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Kissing Ben, Rey will learn, is the most effective way to get him to stop thinking. His shock is palpable through their connection, but it passes quickly, overcome by the ardent yearning that was always there, patient, brought to life by her touch.     She cups his face while they kiss, not letting go even when she manages to climb into his lap, and when her hands tangle between the curls at his nape and   pull , deepening the kiss, the sound Ben made would have made her weak at the knees had she been standing. But Ben would catch her, always. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*16. Angular: acting or moving awkwardly. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*  No more waiting . She climbs into Ben's lap like they’ve done this a thousand times before. Kissing Rey is easy; nothing’s angular, nothing’s unfamiliar. Her mouth lets him in willingly, his hands travel down her body to settle on her waist. There’s no shyness in the way her tongue finds his, no need to hide the sweet sounds they coax out of each other. This is what they’re meant to be— deeply woven trust. It’s in the way she kisses his scar, in the way he gently holds her.     “I—”     “I know,” he whispers. “And this time I am staying.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*When James disobeys Miranda must enforce her orders. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*His cravat felt rough and uncomfortable against James’ lips. What sounds of protest tried to escape from him were muffled by the gag Miranda had, very skilfully, tied against his mouth.  “You were warned not to speak, lieutenant,” Miranda said. “I’m disappointed to see naval discipline leaves a lot to be desired.”  James had been warned to lay perfectly still and silent as Miranda used his prick for her enjoyment, but he’d disobeyed, begging for release. Now he had no choice but to be silent as she fucked herself on his cock and moaned her pleasure over and over again. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Hector and John are young lovers trying new things. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Months into their affair John had thought he and Hector had tasted all the delights men enjoy with each other, but he was wrong. What a discovery it was, the firm grip Hector had on John’s arse, spreading him wide open for the gentle, devastating touch of his tongue on John’s opening.   There had hardly been any need for John to touch himself before he came. It had taken his breath away. He almost missed the moment Hector spilled between John’s spread thighs, the feel of Hector collapsing on him, the open mouth kisses he laid on John’s shuddering back. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*George Everett has a new toy to play with (and it’s not Lord John). *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“Are you not curious at all, John?”   He opened his eyes to look at George. He held an artifact of unmistakable purpose, bigger than George’s own prick. It was made of ivory, its entire surface delicately carved. He could feel himself shudder just to think of how it would feel inside him.  John spread his legs, eyes closed.  “Good boy,” George said.  It was cold, unyielding, uncaring of John’s reactions. It stretched him wider than he’d have thought comfortable. Deep inside, rubbing against that terrible, blissful spot, John could feel the smooth carvings, bringing him closer and closer to oblivion. *~*TEXT*~*

Staying vulnerable, asking clearly for what I need. “Of you ending this. Giving up on me.” “That’s not how I’ll punish you. Not ever.” I sag with relief. Before the first lash, he says only, “Try harder, next time.” “I will, sir. Thank you, sir.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*秘书把白宇扶回家的时候，是朱一龙开的门。 她偶尔因公事出入白家，是见过这个小少爷的。听说是白宇的远方亲戚，因为上学的缘故，寄宿在这里。 少年看到满身酒气的白宇，微不可察得蹙了蹙眉，伸手接过了男人的大部分重量，还能分神对她露出感激的笑容。他有一双小鹿似的眼睛，亮晶晶的，看向人的时候，眼神里都是全然的信任。 他似乎被白宇保护得很好。 但她太清楚了，白宇绝对不是什么善茬，更不要提养个远亲的小孩这么久。 然而这是老板的私事，她本不该过多揣摩的。她敛了心神，帮着朱一龙把白宇扶到沙发上，打了个招呼，匆匆离开了。   朱一龙从没见过白宇醉成这个样子，也就对自己即将经历的事一无所知。 他学着从前母亲照顾父亲那样，用水沾湿毛巾，轻轻得给白宇擦脸。还没擦两下，就被白宇一把掀翻在沙发上。酒后滚烫的身体从背后压了上来，罩住了少年纤细的身体。 白宇像老鹰啄食一样，一口叼住了朱一龙的后颈，手掌也探入他的衣裤，裹住臀肉，没轻没重得掐揉了几下。 “白叔叔，你弄痛我了…” 白宇根本听不见朱一龙在说什么，他的大脑被酒精蒸腾成一团浆糊，一切的动作都是出于本能。 朱一龙也不跟白宇计较，醉酒的人哪有听话的。他努力翻过身，双手推拒着白宇的胸膛。 白宇被他推得不耐烦了，反手一巴掌甩在臀尖上，少年白皙的臀肉上立刻浮现出一个清晰的手印，小鹿一样的眼睛里，噙上了泪水。 “白叔叔…啊！” 白宇粗暴得镇压了朱一龙的反抗，他双手压住朱一龙的膝弯，拽着他的小腿架在肩膀上，低头含住了少年软在身前的肉茎。 性器一进入到那处湿热的口腔，朱一龙几乎是立刻就硬了。 他的小腿情不自禁地勾住了白宇的后背，少年的身体柔软而美好，被白宇用臂弯圈在这一方天地中，仿佛被一头雄狮牢牢护在羽翼之下。   白宇才给他含了几下，少经人事的少年就激动得快射了，连带着身后那个穴口都开始扇合，自己张开一指宽的小口，露出里面肉粉色的肠壁，无声地勾引着年长的男人。 白宇想都没想就吮住了朱一龙的后穴，丝毫不给少年反应的时间，下一秒舌尖就顶了进去。 “呜啊…不要，白叔叔……不要…” 这太过了…… 朱一龙屈起小臂挡住眼睛，两颗豆大的泪珠滚出他的眼角，顺着他的脸颊滑下，在手臂的阴影里落进了沙发布料。少年从来没有被他的白叔叔这样作弄过，他的一切性经验都来自白宇。但他不是小孩子了，他知道羞耻。 白宇从前对朱一龙做过最过分的事，也不过是并起少年的双腿，滚烫的欲望插入他稚嫩的腿根间，把那里当成另一个当做发泄的渠道而已。   但白宇现在正在做更过分的事情，他作乱地在少年的肉壁上戳刺，搅得他淫水和泪水都止不住得淌。 朱一龙就像一只被撬开了的蚌，白宇的舌尖钻了进来，抵着g点来回挑拨，要吃他身体里最鲜美的那块肉。 他很快就成功了。 朱一龙拽着白宇的头发，尖叫着，十只白嫩嫩的脚趾蜷缩起来，身体反向弓起。殷红的穴肉抽搐着，痉挛着，紧紧咬住白宇的手指。 他幼鹿一般的小小少年，在他身下，第一次到达了前列腺高潮。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*John woke up on Stephan von Namtzen’s bed with a sore arse and the biggest smile on his face.   The previous night had been a revelation. John had long feared he might endanger their friendship because of his misplaced lust. Now he realised he’d been a fool to believe he could ever mistake von Namtzen for anyone else. James Fraser’s shoulders were not this broad, nor would his back arch so eagerly to John’s touch.   “Good morning, John,” Stephan said. He smiled as he pulled John on top of him, drawing him down between his strong thighs.   “Good morning indeed.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It was not an act of Thomas’ particular preference. It called for skill, but most importantly it called for trust. And there was no one in this world Thomas trusted more than Miranda.   When Thomas’ thoughts got away from him he needed an anchor to tie him to his body and release him from himself. Thomas knew what to ask for. Miranda’s slender fingers and endless patience slowly stretched him open until her entire hand was inside him, a most gentle fist. The pleasure and understanding they shared was a tide that left nothing but blissful silence on its wake. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*In the end he goes to Morgan, just like she said he would.   He walks into her court naked apart from the blood of those who tried to stop him. He warned them, begged them, pleaded with them to let him go. He told them what he'd do and they hadn't listened and he tried to stop himself but he couldn't. He killed them anyway -- just like she said he would.  She sits there, on her throne; he falls at her feet but meets her eyes, assumes the position of the supplicant but holds himself as her equal.  Morgan has no equals. She finds his pride amusing. She always has.  Are they alive, little one, or did you eat them?  He bares his teeth at her, shows her the muscle and sinew caught between each tooth, lets the light catch the incarnadine glimmer of his gums, the bone-ivory glint of his teeth.  Morgan laughs, leans forward to run fingers through his hair. He purrs under her touch.  And what did you think of them, little one? What did you think of your pack?    You were right , he says.  Just like always.    Welcome home , she says.  I've been waiting for you.  *~*TEXT*~*

Biting kisses, until Shiro's mouth was swollen and red. Shiro, at least, managed to get their pants down far enough that they could rub against each other, dry and dirty. Finally, Keith was getting the chance to put his hands on Shiro's ass, rub his fingers all over the beautiful muscles of his thighs. It should have been awkward. First times usually were. But even as they were coming all over each other, frantic and messy, ruining the couch with sweat, Keith couldn't find it in himself to feel anything but pleased. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“I want you,” Harry said, and Merlin fuck , he might collapse soon, but at least he’d do it on top of Draco.  There was that pause again, then a light, non-committal hum. “You can have me,” Draco said, voice low and promising. Then, because he seriously  was  an absolute  rat fucking bastard  added, “After one hundred and twenty-five.”  -  Motivation  by  @bixgirl1   –  To the lovely  @bixgirl1  , and your delicious, motivating story.  I love how these boys can be so snarky and so supportive at the same time, and you are masterful at writing their dynamic.  I hope you enjoy your half-naked foam friends as much as I enjoy reading your works!     Tsundanire  and the Drarry Discord, you all are absolute treasures.  Thanks for letting me be a part of your squad.     *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Daisy can't help but think of Basira as innocent. Prompt: Bloody Hands *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*All Basira gets out is "Dais--" and then there are lips pressing against hers; Daisy walks her backwards into her hallway using just her mouth and her sheer force of will, her bloodied hands hovering at Basira's waist without touching.   "Want you," Daisy mumbles against the column of Basira's throat, and there's a quick, bright flash of teeth against her skin that makes Basira's breath catch. Daisy's hands twitch at the sound, but she can't quite make herself touch--fearful, maybe, about getting blood on Basira's clothes. Always so hesitant to tarnish what she insists on thinking of as Basira's innocence.   So Basira grabs Daisy's hand, paints her lips with one crimson-slick finger before sucking it into her mouth, letting her eyes slip closed as she sucks away metal-sweet blood. When she opens her eyes, Daisy is staring, her eyes dark and wanting. "So take me," Basira says, and it hovers in the air like something delicate and breakable, until Daisy lunges forward to finally shatter it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Stan and Ford run into some issues with changes Ford has had in the portal. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*When Ford told Stan he had changed in the portal, Stan assumed he meant being less of a dick. “Well?” asked Ford, as Stan stared at the writhing mass of tentacles where Ford’s dick used to be. “Are you—is it too…?” “It’s… fine,” Stan answered, gently. “Nothing a fellow can’t get used to.” “Right,” said Ford. He looked unsure, though. Stan thought back to all the other times Ford was made to feel the freak. “So let’s get used to it!” He eagerly licked the tentacles, letting them cup his face. Ford smiled. “Good, isn’t it?” Stan grinned back. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Just a snapshot of three women taking peace for themselves *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Aayla smiled at the absolutely peaceful look on Shaak's face, even as she ran fingers over the elder woman's hip, tracing the white marking there. She shifted a little, allowing Luminara more room to continue teasing Shaak's lek on the other side. The contrast of red and green and blue skin was another visual stimulation.  These explorations of one another were so rare, and such a treasure for them each. Tomorrow, Luminara would leave for her unit again, released from medical care. Shaak would leave in the afternoon, taking wounded troops back to Kamino for further rehabilitation. And Aayla herself would return to the unit she had been given later this very evening.  Now, though, was for finding those differences between their species, the ones that led to gentle words for guidance, or giggles for inadvertent tickling. Now was forgetting the war, kissing one another, and just being women together.  "I think… my turn… is quite over," Shaak said, wriggling free of her younger lovers. She chased a kiss down from Luminara, before meeting Aayla's eyes. "Which makes it your turn, little love," she purred.  Aayla moved willingly, gaining her own kiss from Luminara, before all thoughts fled their skills. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*This was the dream life...  But, I've always noticed those side glances coming from a very cute, but sexy boy, Park Jimin and this is noticed not only by me, but by taetae and kookie too...  and those glances were not "normal" glances, but were glances of lust, and want.  So one day, the three of us decided to show a lil' something about our other side of our relationship which isn't always sweet, cute and romantic~to Jimin, and make him experience a once in a lifetime oppurtunity-because, come on, sex with the two of them is amazing and im in euphoria(A/N:( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) when i do have sex with those two sex gods.  Well one can only hope on what would happen next! I am absolutely excited for the events thatll take place.     Park Jimin's going to go for a wild ride with us. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Annabeth had been right. Percy did drool when he slept.  But he also looked peaceful and at ease. The weight of the world no longer on his shoulders. The morning sunlight highlighting every gorgeous imperfection on his tan skin. Beautiful.  Jason reached for a tissue to clean him up a bit.  Percy grumbled something that sounded like “what are you doing?”  “You drool when you sleep,” Jason whispered.  “Sorry…” he said, waking up. His chin now on Jason’s naked chest.  “It’s fine,” Jason said.  “You’d think my mouth would’ve dried up, y’know, with all the sucking and whatnot.”  Jason sighed. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Seth stabbed his brothers in the back with a steel chair, left his morals in the mud, and put a target on his back. All to get a title shot, to pull himself forwards, to join the Authority. They said they would  protect  them.  Somehow, them not holding up their end of that deal was more surprising than the knife in his gut.   And, somehow, the only thing he’s learned from this is that touching your own organs is  weird .  They feel  slimy , and his intestines feel almost tangled. It doesn’t hurt, even though he can see a wide cut in his small intestine. Well, it  hurts,  but in a weird way. It’s dull, cottony, almost unnoticeable, especially compared to the pain of his torso being torn open.   He doesn’t know who did this to him, but before he passes out from blood loss, his mind offers  Dean . He thinks about him and Roman as he dies anyway. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*死里逃生了一回，白羽瞳因祸得福地，被展耀彻底宠成了大爷。 大爷的福利体现在生活各处。 喝水有人倒，吃饭有人喂，腰酸背痛有人捶，更别提他恢复初期，连上个厕所遛个鸟，也有人帮他扶。 这个人，自然是展耀。 等到白大爷恢复了那么一丢丢，那充分利用现有资源的心思越发活泛起来，这福利也就从床下慢慢发展到了床上。  两人虽是双箭头多年，但碍着那么点自尊，非得经过生离死别才终于敞开心怀告了白，真正在一起的时间，从白羽瞳苏醒的那一天算起，还不到一个月。 言下之意，成为情侣后的负距离接触，两人至今尚未践行。 没践行不代表不想践行，更何况白大爷整天躺在床上百无聊赖的，那么点露骨的目光全用来招呼眼前怎么看怎么秀色可餐的人了。 白大爷眼珠子那么一转，半靠在了床头。 “猫儿，我身上痒。” “哪儿痒？”展耀也没多想，只当白羽瞳是伤口又难受了，走上来就要拉开他的衣领查看。 白羽瞳等的可不就是这一刻嘛。 他就手把展耀腕子那么一拉，又轻巧一带，短短数秒，展耀就被迫趴在了白羽瞳的身上。 这姿势在旁人看来，真是写满了欲拒还迎的主动。 展耀怕碰着白羽瞳的伤口，也不敢真往他身上压。 他双手撑在床面两侧，直瞪着近在咫尺的俊脸，眉毛一下揪了起来：“怎么养个病还这么不安分？” 那话里满满的谴责想当然地被白羽瞳忽略了。 “猫儿，我那儿痒。”白羽瞳用鼻尖蹭着眼前的人，声音低软地拐出了九曲十八弯，“你帮我摸一摸嘛，好不好？” 展耀的脸瞬间红上了额头尖儿。 摸......摸一摸？  白羽瞳的病号裤早被他自己扒了，他光着两条大长腿，穿着子弹裤，大爷一样地躺在枕头上，这子弹裤自然也是白色的。 “猫儿，你也把裤子脱了吧。” 白羽瞳说着就往展耀的皮带上伸手，被展耀闪身一躲。 “你给我老实点！” “我还不老实？”白羽瞳哀声抱怨，象征性地往上挺了挺腰，“我这都老实二十多年了，再老实下去，我都能当柳下惠了！” 展耀瞪他一眼，却是慢慢脱下长裤，露出莹白细长的两条腿。 流畅紧致的线条从脚踝攀沿至大腿根，把白羽瞳看得眼都直了。 他没忍住咽了咽口水，不耐地挪了挪身体。 “猫儿，”白羽瞳的声音微微做哑，像带着最深的蛊惑，“坐上来。” 展耀的靛蓝风衣挂在椅子上，他全身上下只剩一件白衬衫，衬衫下摆力有不逮地虚盖至大腿根，只稍稍一动，就引出无数遐思。 果然是被蛊惑了，展耀竟有些怔愣。 他控制不住地叫白羽瞳的深邃目光锁住了身体，随着那只有力的手掌伸到面前，他连犹豫都来不及，就那么把自己交了出去。  大腿一抬，露出股间诱人风情，白羽瞳眸光一暗，扶着展耀的腰坐到了自己的腿根处。 蓄势待发的部位隔着两层薄棉打了个招呼，烫得空气都升了温。 看着眼前半垂着头的爱人，白羽瞳发出喟叹的轻唤：“猫儿，我的猫儿。” 昵称叫语间低回牵引出缠绵，在那眸光牵引下，展耀抬起头，慢慢将身体靠了过来。 双唇相贴在一处，初时轻轻地细细地去抿，抿出薄薄水意，像润了久旱的失地，然后那失地逢了春，顿生出漫天的春雨。 展耀的唇较一般男人更为精巧秀气，此刻被白羽瞳紧含在唇间，吸吮出声声沉迷的轻吟，又被舌尖尽数包裹。 趁着爱人迷乱的当口，白羽瞳灵巧的手指勾住展耀的棉质裤边，捏了捏他的屁股。 “抬起来一点。” 掌中圆润的屁股先是紧而一僵，没多会便稍稍翘起。 感觉到脖间被环得更紧，白羽瞳快速脱下了那条碍事的内裤，倒不忘咬着展耀的耳垂哑声道：“真乖。” 话刚出口，肩头就被狠咬了一口，果然是牙尖嘴利的小猫儿。  顺着纤细的腰线，白羽瞳寻着了展耀微颤滚烫的手。 他抓着那手摸上自己腿间的鼓囊，低声诱惑道：“猫儿，帮我脱。” 掌中的滑嫩手面似是抗拒地挣了挣，片刻后又像是妥协般卸了力气，顺着内裤边颤抖着摸了进去。 白羽瞳配合着微微抬臀，棉质布料自他腿根慢慢下滑，带出皮肤敏感的触碰。 久被束缚的硬挺终于突破了桎梏，于空气中肆意张扬出危险的挺拔。 相对于展耀的秀挺，白羽瞳的阴茎更像是骄傲的将军，抵剑相向对准了志在必得的人，宣告着接下来的侵占决心。 两根不时相碰，每一下都带出过电的痉挛爽意。 白羽瞳早是满头的汗水，哪里还能再忍？ 他低喘着握住展耀的腰往身前一压，这一下，两根灼热终于紧紧地交缠在了一起。  展耀的双股被白羽瞳攥紧在掌中，极有频率地托起又放下，拖带着两人的阴茎一上一下地紧贴着厮磨，一下下撞出皮下的快感，又顺着神经末梢的电流汇聚成汪洋，直直冲上了头皮。 展耀被那快感折磨，不由自主地用手去抚慰。 两根发红的茎体于细白长指间穿梭摩擦，擦出顶端不断流出的透白前液，点点落在了白羽瞳紧绷的小腹上。 展耀的下唇叫白羽瞳咬在口中，忍不住伸出舌头去舔，舔到白羽瞳鼻尖上的细汗，无意识地又舔了一道，就听白羽瞳低吼一声，薄茧的大掌包住他的，加快了身下的套弄。 越来越快的频率让展耀从未有过地惶恐，他全身烧出了火，要害还叫人拿在掌中不要命地磨。 他呜咽一声咬住眼前唯一可掌控的唇，下身快感越强，他便无意识咬得越狠。 口中传来汗意咸涩的腥甜，刺激得头脑更加昏沉。白光一瞬间，他高叫出呻吟，迎来了小腹几道灼热的喷射。  射精后的空虚让人酥软着不想去动，展耀搂着白羽瞳的脖子靠在他的身上，颈间叫这人啄吻得发痒。 两人的身下仍旧微颤地皮肉紧贴，偶尔的搏动绵延着余韵，似乎还诉出几分不满足。 这不满足的自然还是他白大爷。 白大爷轻拍着展耀湿乎乎的屁股，手指不怀好意地往那股间幽径拂过一把。 下次一定要动真格的! 白大爷咬牙切齿地想，明天他一定要多喝一碗乳鸽汤！ *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Carrie has a healthy sex life and no intention to let herself be tied down again. She tried that once already and frankly, Al and she are way better as friends and partners. She also has a workload that would make lesser women cry, bad habits she refuses to shed and less opportunity that she would like to meet new interesting people. That’s why she loves working with other agencies when their cases are tied together. People with the same crazy workload understand her desire to not waste time. And no one better than Agent Anthony, call me Tony, DiNozzo. It’s sad for the three Marine whose killer they chased together, but a perfect occasion to meet each other. After five crazy days where they were shoot, twice, participated in car chases, thrice, and defused a bomb, once only but it was enough, they count the hours until DiNozzo must take his plane. And the orgasms. For now, it’s two for him and four for her. That man really has an agile tongue. In the bed looking every hour more like the scene of a great battle, Carrie is sure they can do better in the time they have left. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He locked himself up very well, the little agent of the Eye, but not well enough. He nearly made it to his bedroom before he was overwhelmed, collapsing to the floor and clamping both hands over his mouth, eyes squeezing shut.   	"That..." Jane said, "isn't helping..."   	Martin screamed and arched his back off the floor, the muscles in his leg seizing as the Hive burrowed into the flesh of it. Above him he heard laughter, melodic and cruel, and his last thought before the world went white was that at least the Archivist wouldn't want for proof of his fate. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*His forehead pressed against his arms, his knees partly rubbed raw on the wood floor already, Kisuke smiles. Pride always was Mayuri’s weakness. He needed only allow himself to be injured, then keep apart from the battlefield, and feign embarrassment, to awaken a need for recognition that still, after more than a century, leaves the other shinigami as vulnerable as a human newborn. One hand clenched over the wound, his gaze low, falsely mortified, an ill-disguised shiver while receiving care ; the ruse was so simple, it was almost disappointing. Then again, results alone matter : Mayuri has abandoned every pretence of composure and he is now pouring all of his energy, all of his  talent , into making him come. Kisuke would laugh with satisfaction, were his voice not strangled by his former assistant’s sex, hands, and  reiatsu . His victory is only partly silent though : Mayuri’s groans are telling him, loud and clear, that he belongs to him. *~*TEXT*~*

She was leaning against something warm that smelled of leather, salt and sweat.  she tried to say, but found herself gagged, hands bound behind her back. Her heart beat rapidly as her eyes flew open, pain lancing through her head. She sat up clumsily and carefully scanned her surroundings. Bars, covered by a tarp and - Yasha, whose eyes were closed, blood streaking down her pale face and pooling behind a muzzle. She remembered the eerily silent fight, Yasha falling and Fjord – Fjord! Her eyes found his in the dim light of the cage. Fjord's yellow eyes were wide, his chest rising and falling rapidly. He was muzzled as well, hands tied behind his back. There was blood on his face as well and he looked at her pleadingly, his stoic mask shattered. Jester screamed. It only came out as a muffled yell. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*'I'm all yours sweetie.'  Mels looked into the Doctor's eyes. Her whole life she'd waited for this moment. Raised from a baby to do this, to kill the Doctor. She took in his strong jaw, his eyes, full of loving but concealing such a deep rooted hurt that she could hardly bare it. Now. It had to be now. She planted a kiss on the Doctor's soft lips. Such a thing, a kiss. Capable of making hearts, of breaking hearts, of breaking people.   'Only River Song gets to call me that.'  That name again. But what did it mean? Mels struggled to fight down the hurt that fought its way into being. Why was she feeling that? It's not like she cared. She supposed she's never know what that name meant, because the Doctor was finished, and she had earned her life. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*"You never know what lurks in the depths of the water. Even if you think nothing is there."  This is a crossover between the TV show of Siren and the movie of Wrong Turn. But in this alternate universe the merpeople are deformed, maneating, and ten times aggressive than the original merpeople from Siren. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*In the West Virginia Forest lays a lake. It was midnight and the moon was shining with the lake reflecting the light. Every now and then a demented giggle would sound throughout the nearby forest. It wasn't until a feminine scream sounded and the giggling increased greatly. Soon after the giggling stopped there was nothing but peaceful silence. The sight of the lake would have been viewed as beautiful but knowing what lurks not only in these woods but also the water would make the scene look chilling. Suddenly a head Rose from the water. From a distance it looked like a woman. But as you get close you realize it is indeed not a woman. It had long brown hair, blazing blue eyes that could cut through your soul and force you to tell all of your wrong doings, and teeth that would make even a shark envious. The creature stared out into the woods and then ducked back underwater. As the creature disappeared into the water you could see it's dorsal fin on it's back and sharp quills protruding down its tail. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*John admits to Percy he wants to know what being whipped feels like. Percy never forgets. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*It had been an odd impulse to give into, a suggestion Percy wouldn’t have otherwise put forward, but there’d been something peculiar in John’s eyes: hunger veiled by regret, curiosity, and shame.  Percy was surprised when John said yes. He had so beautifully followed Percy’s orders, making himself bare. The lines the cat-o’nine-tails left on John’s back were a work of art.  When sleep eludes him Percy often thinks of that moment, of John’s quiet sighs and himself hardening. In Percy’s dreams there is time to kiss, for John to bend over a table and offer himself, asking for more. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*On this fateful day we arrive upon a rather bewildering scene. In the depths of the anyteyln city, where no moth man or woman dared to venture, we find a peculiar sight.  And that sight is Sam Adoxaceae rather valiantly attempting to insert a large rock into his buttocks.  It was a rather hard situation. Perhaps he should be boulder about his approach.  The rock falters and falls to the ground, twas a solid attempt.  “It’s all ore nothing.” Sam sighs, pushing it once again.  At the sight of his failure, the yellow moth boy realizes the truth of the situation.  He’s hit rock bottom. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*事后，花无谢以逆转阴阳需要多次疗养为名，将裴文德依旧留于宫中，朱厚照只能来探视却不能进行房事。 “在未完成之前，陛下万万不可如此，否则将会阴阳两气相冲，前功尽弃。” 无奈的裴文德能怎么办呢？箭到弦上，不得不发。依照裴家的势力，慢慢在朝中安插自己的人手，准备着两人的密谋之计。 他与花无谢无论是身还是心，已经是一条船上的蚂蚱，再也分不开了。不得不说，时间的力量是惊人的。花无谢在寂寞深宫中的陪伴是他的唯一寄托，也是重返自由的唯一希望。在疯狂的交合中，万千春潮的激情将他的心献了出去。 而花无谢给这颗心上了把锁。他在裴文德细瘦的小腿处，上了一把做工精致的银锁。银光闪闪，衬着洁白如玉的小腿更是晶莹，多了分禁欲的美感。双腿被锁着，走路自然不大方便，穿着一袭红袍的裴文德逛御花园时都一颤一颤的，弱柳扶风的样子仿佛真是被夺了阳气。 他汗涔涔地从御花园回来，花郎中躺在龙床上等着他，半露衣衫，胸口风光大好。 “你这登徒子”裴文德扶着腰说道。 花无谢一个快步起身，搂住了裴文德的肩膀，“不登徒子，怎么勾得正人君子的裴大将军上龙床啊”，花无谢的手滑向衣带，轻轻一解，宽大的袍子倏地落下。 习惯了他任性妄为性子的裴文德也就由着他，里里外外褪下的衣衫由门口铺到了床第，花无谢解开他束发的红带子，满头墨发散落在白净如玉的肩胛骨上，花无谢将他推倒在明黄色的龙床上，温暖的手触碰到了银锁，发出银铃般的响声。裴文德的脸更红了，花无谢勾起唇角，露出贪婪的目光，“裴裴你是我的” 他咬上裴文德细嫩的小腿，细细啃噬，绕着银锁的周围留下了一片片红痕，才把锁解开，让小腿不停颤抖的裴文德喘了口气。 花无谢继续向大腿深处探去，习武的手带着薄茧摩擦过常年不见光的大腿私密处，富有经验地揉捏。他知道什么地方裴文德最敏感，果不其然，轻轻一按裴公子就弓起腰来。 这具白玉般的身子已经被自己调教得很水灵，稍微一撩拨，就能泛起红来，他俯下身子靠在裴文德灼热的阳物上，低低笑道“我好像已经听到裴裴的水声了” 裴文德面红耳赤，从前饱读的圣贤教诲又在耳边响起，他心中充满着强烈的背德感，可花无谢却要引着他走向极致。他含着他灼热的阳物，发出啧啧吮吸的声音，两根手指插进了后穴，前后夹击的快感让裴文德闭上了眼睛。白日宣淫，天子龙床，男男交合，这一切一切的背德让从小的乖孩子生出莫名的快感。裴文德知道这样不对，可他就觉得身子快乐极了。 花无谢的手指像是生长在小穴里的怪物，粗糙有力地研磨过薄薄的肠壁，将里面的营养吃干抹净。怪物的指甲搔着敏感的花穴，想要刮擦出更多的水来，好喂饱另一张嘴。花无谢吮吸着裴文德的前端，渗出的精液流向他的嘴里。他轻快地用手一抹，一股白浊在他晶亮的嘴唇边划出一道弧线，美极了。 他捏着裴文德被他拍得浑圆通红的屁股，挺着硕大阳物进入了他。此刻他变成了战场上攻城略地的将军，而裴文德是他被他追杀的兵卒。裴文德的手抓着花无谢的脊背，在一抽一插中划出十道血痕，“呵，我的裴裴越来越像只发情的母猫了”，花无谢恶意地揉捏着裴文德腰窝，要他挤出情色的呐喊来。 灼热的阳物找到了敏感点，发疯似的撞击起来。裴文德出了薄汗，三千青丝散乱在床第，几根粘腻在白净的胸膛上，如玉的脸满是绯色，像是落日的晚霞，美不胜收。 他的小穴不可抑制地溢出水来，波涛汹涌，欢迎着更凶猛的撞击。而裴文德本人却被情欲逼紧了神经，咬着红唇。 花无谢不甘心，想要索取更多。他将四根手指伸进裴文德的嘴里，让他含着吮吸，裴文德不答应，他就艹弄得更猛烈，像是最无情的野兽，裴文德被他弄得无法，笨拙地含着，流下丝丝银液。 花无谢看着他这副纯情模样就更为心荡神摇，将手指插得更深，身下也愈发研磨着那一点销魂。快感笼罩了两人，谁能想到紫禁城最得圣宠的裴贵妃正在他人身下承欢，严正禁欲的外表发出春色满满的淫叫。 两人正在高潮，突然一声熟悉的叫声传来，“裴卿，朕来看你了” TBC. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*股间就忽然顶来一个半硬的家伙。  林风堪堪松开他，拉出一道银丝。  俩人对视一眼，章远还吭哧吭哧喘着粗气，边大口呼吸边笑，“你怎么跟发情似的。”林风也跟着笑一声才要搭话，章远手机铃就响了，两人一耸，大眼瞪小眼还是认命地接了起来。  “喂。”  “远哥，你哪儿去了，给你发消息你不回，兄弟都回来了——你吭哧吭哧干嘛呢。”  “刚跑圈了，”章远瞪了眼林风，拍掉前来作祟的手，“你们都回去了？今晚不是通宵吗。”  “过会儿去网咖，你来不来？”  “我就算了，明一早就走。”  寝室那兄弟很没眼力见儿地又跟章远瞎鸡儿扯淡，恨得林风现在就想顺着无线电冲过去提溜着人衣领上来一顿暴打，靠，有事儿说事儿没事儿滚蛋，少跟我媳妇瞎鸡巴扯淡。  “干嘛啊你一脸不爽，”章远挂断电话瞅着林风一张黑脸扑哧笑了，“人有女朋友，不跟你抢。”  “有女朋友还跟我男朋友聊骚，欠拾掇。”说着又缠了上去，年轻气盛不小心就会擦枪走火，林风撸着章远的腰把头埋进他颈窝，吭哧吭哧地笑，“宝贝儿，撒野吗？”  “现在？”章远贴着他的脸颊，也不知道是谁在发烫。  “嗯，现在。”  章远被林风扑倒在柔软的细劲草中，手垫在章远脑后免得磕痛了他的头，林风急切地撩开粉色毛衣的前襟，却入眼一层白色屏障，掀开撕开裂开，林风从他胸膛一路吻到肚脐，下巴隔着柔软的布料蹭在胀起的性器上，股间散着潮热。  “又热又湿，你是不是连撸都懒得撸？”林风腿他的裤子，转眼只光裸着两天纤瘦却硬梆梆满是肌肉的大腿，一丛葳蕤之中颤巍巍翘着一根腻着淫液的玉柱。  “懒。”章远抬手去拉他裤链，扯着牛仔裤往下拽，他们就像背着大人偷情的孩子，藏着隐秘而躁动的心，这种感觉和在旷野无人的草原上还不同，这是在社会的眼皮下偷偷宣泄，总怀着被抓包的刺激感，“赶紧的，一会儿被人发现了。”  “你记不记得高二那年在学校澡堂的时候。”林风吻着他，从屁兜摸出一枚冈本，借着章远尖尖的虎牙撕开，“那时候还小，比较耸，干了就刺激了。”  “还好意思说呢，”章远抬腿搭在林风肩头，承着林风忽然捅进来的手指，忍不住嘶了一声，“让你口你都怂。”  两根手指慢慢撑着穴口打旋，林风挑着眉笑，“是是是，现在就给你口，爽翻了不准叫。”  “哎我操——”尾音落在倒吸凉气的声音里。  林风口活儿都是在章远身上练出来的，章远的小蛇有什么敏感点，轻重缓急，掐哪里是七寸他都一清二楚，林风不着急整根吞入，而是边给章远扩张边舔咬着圆润饱满的柱头，舌尖挤进铃口勾出腥膻。  章远红着眼呜咽，抬手轻轻咬住自己的手腕免得林风弄太狠忍不住娇声连连，章远眼前蒙了水汽，另一手似是无意识地揉捻着胸前充血挺立的乳首。章远自慰的手法还很生疏，这一个月也就堪堪自己捅了自己一回，还是用手摸索着，插进穴口摸了半天摸不到敏感点，笑自己还不如林风了解自己的身体。  三管齐下，让他整个人软成融化的奶糖。  “宝贝儿。”  “嗯。”打着颤，好似一条猫尾搔着林风掌心。  忽然就被撑开然后填满，像虚在云端忽然就有了着落。  “唔……风儿。”章远的身子软颤。  穴口像一只收缩的环儿一般紧紧箍在林风的性器上，子孙囊垂在穴口摩挲着敏感纤薄的内侧皮肤，惹得章远连连战栗，不自觉流露出的娇声和太息撞着林风胸口。  穴道壁贴着饱胀的性器，恰恰契合，章远穴道要短，很容易就顶到前列腺下的软肉，林风常常擦着前列腺深深埋入，再退出，龟头一圈凸起恰恰成为柔软的倒刺勾着前列腺的神经，一阵阵麻头皮的快感，操得章远恍惚又迷离，飘飘欲仙。  啪声清脆，性器与穴口之间磨合发出嘬啵嘬啵的水声，在幽静隐秘的林间更显淫荡。  是少年熄不灭的火，在对方身上挂满白浊，揉进血骨的爱在乍起的秋夜中铮铮生风。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*A small morning after story from one of Daff's many lovers, mostly for fictober's day 7 prompt *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Daff stretched his arms as he woke up, his legs tangeled in the expensive sheets of a bed that was not his own. He blinked blearily as sunlight streamed through the windows and studied the room he had so clumsily entered in the heat of the night.  It was a good sized room with two large windows on either side of the bed and a tall bookshelf next to the door. Outside he could hear the city already bustling with it's daily business.  Then, the door to the room opened and a dark blue tifling entered holding a tray with bread and soup on it, placing it down on the bedside table next to Daff and leaning in, giving Daff a kiss.  "I had a lot of fun last night, you sure know your way around the bedroom." He said softly.  Daff winked and said lustfully "You weren't so bad yourself pretty boy. Maybe I'll show you a few more tricks later."   The tifling smiled "I'd like that." and pulled Daff into another kiss, which he enthusiastically accepted.   Breaking the kiss the tifling asked "Do you have to leave today?"  “No worries, we still have time.” Daff replied. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Changkyun wants to do a masters. Fine. He wants to write on modern phenomena. Fine. Furries as a postmodern gay sex cult? Kihyun wishes repression was still fashionable. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Changkyun’s father was a scientist and if he had to… that’s where it began, he’d say. He’d bring home old dogs and cats- occasionally something more exotic, and run vague tests on them and say ruefully to Changkyun “They’re just like us you know.”   He wasn’t really interested in the chemicals or systems making these animals act the way they did, like his father was, but rather in the way they acted. He watched dogs wag their tails and would run his hands over his back, to his tailbone and feel strangely empty. He watched cats cock their ears and and feel his odd, flat head.   Changkyun liked hip hop for its baggy pants as much as its lyricism; he could almost pretend a tail was coiled in the loose fabric and in a moment of weakness he cut himself a mohawk, which swayed upright on his head, almost like cats’ ears did. Changkyun lived his half life, not quite a boy, not quite an animal, Until he joined Monsta X.    Kihyun heaved a sigh "Changkyun- a dissertation is not meant to be a narration of your life. By someone else too- why are you writing in third person?" *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Trust is a big thing in their relationship, mostly due to everything that’s happened to them. With forming Voltron, defeating the Galra Empire...twice and finally arriving home to Earth.  But even home they still have a hard time trusting anyone but themselves.  “Keith, I don’t know” Shiro mumbled as he held a blindfold in his Altean hand and glanced at his lover.  “It’s fine. Trust me” Keith smiled and took the blindfold before he placed it over his own eyes, a second later he felt it tie in place, Keith took in a sharp breath as he felt his heart speed up, as everything went black. He jumped when the cool hand pressed against his chest and slowly pushed him down.  Keith took a deep breath and let it out slowly, he could hear Shiro shifted around and remove his pants. He could feel how close Shiro was and how the bed dipped.  He could trust Shiro, he let out a moan when warmth covered his member and bucked.  Oh yeah, he could trust Shiro  *~*TEXT*~*

"I promise that I won't use glitter when I decorate the Hub again, sir. Please, please, suck my cock." Jack finished tying the bow around Ianto's dick. "Good boy," and he swallowed him. *~*TEXT*~*

You know I become cold, lifeless,  A marionette with the strings severed when you withdraw.  I die in slow seconds without you,  Needing to slake my thirst on your sweat, my hunger on your flesh My soul cries for out you,  Across the chasm between us,  An ache for your burning, blinding light, Suffering and slaking both,  A desire for worship that requires you close,  So I can die in your arms again. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*之前，因为是夏天，出香可能是在家里习惯了，还没有来得及把提防男性的哥哥提上日程表。所以没有穿内衣，那两点直接凸在了睡衣平滑的表面上。 我在那天，用目光不经意间捕获她乳头的形状之后。对着拥有和自己几乎一模一样容貌的妹妹，勃起了。 你的睡衣是怎么温柔地摩擦你的乳头的呢？它多么自然地让你的乳头变硬了啊。自然到连你都没有意识到，可怜的自己正在被一直信赖的睡衣，像这样胡来地玩弄着身体呢。 真是令人嫉妒。 ……我有什么资格嫉妒。这样是不对的。哥哥和妹妹又不可以在一起，不可以谈恋爱，不可以结婚。不可以做出格的事。 “……出香。”我缓缓吞咽了一口唾沫，可还是听见自己的嗓子发出连自己都觉得有点危险的声音。 “哥哥？”出香正擦着头发，被水沾湿粘连成块的头发乖乖地搭在她额前，稍稍遮住一点眼睛，但是那份令人火大的纯真却没有被遮住。往下是无知地半开的被水蒸气熏地粉嫩的嘴唇，最过分的刚刚已经提过了，然而上衣下方也破绽百出——没有好好翻好的下摆翘起一个小小的卷边，露出像奶糖一样的一小节腰部，就连短裤下饱满又白嫩的大腿也看上去十分可口。 “……………………内衣。”我低着头，假装屏保在放视频。但其实余光一直在瞥着她。 “…啊！抱歉……！”才发现的出香放下擦头发的手，用小臂遮住了胸口。随着这个动作原本搭在她头发上的毛巾垂下，遮住了她的表情。我猜测她一定又脸红了。她在这点上和我还是很像的…… “下次……一定要记得穿啊。” “……嗯。我记住了。” 后来，出香就再也没有以那种样子出现在我面前过。但尽管如此，那一天那一幕停留在我视网膜上的印象，却足够我用来满足自己好几个月。     =====     说好躲着的。说好不过界的。 但是不知道是不是巧合还是什么，出香哪怕升了国中也还是丢三落四，不是内衣掉在浴室里，就是喝过的水杯就这么往客厅里一摆。 简直就像在对我说快点来拿一样。 我当然不可能拿——     ……啊，我拿了。     ……话说，我为什么会喜欢上出香呢。 是因为我接触的女生太少了，于是性幻想对象什么的只有出香一个女生可以作为参考吗？ 还是说因为人类都是双重标准的生物，据调查显示，大家会更偏向对和自己长得像的人有好感，所以我喜欢上了自己的双胞胎妹妹？ 话说回来，喜欢到底是什么呢？ 喜欢一朵花是喜欢？喜欢欧尔麦特是喜欢？……不。不是这样的。 我回到房间一边安抚自己，一边眯着眼睛胡思乱想。 又一次，我悄悄偷了出香的内裤到自己房间里自慰。放心，我完事之后会非常细心地洗个七八遍，再找机会放回去。 出香的内裤很可爱。和身为欧尔麦特狂热粉丝的我不太一样，出香对欧尔麦特只是路人好感，所以内裤也很正常，是可爱小动物或者糖果色系的那种。 ……我真的没救了。 一瞬间我意识到，原来我自己都没有想到自己会这么喜欢出香，连脑中自动播放解释说明这种话也竟然开始习以为常。我是变态吧。是的吧。 ………唉……变态就变态吧……… 我有一种心如死灰后一阶段的冷静淡然，把房门锁好之后爬上床，将出香的内裤小心翼翼地从裤袋里抽出来，然后，深深地——  我开始妄想。妄想出香和我缠绵的情景。     哈啊……出香。 【怎么啦，哥哥？】 再、再多叫我哥哥吧…… 【诶……哥哥，很喜欢被这样叫吗？】 嗯…… 我喘着气，妄想出香露出她一如既往的、天真无邪的眼神，仰望我的纯洁姿态。 ……哥哥最喜欢你了，像小时候跟哥哥说的那样，不要交男朋友好不好？当哥哥的新娘子好不好？ 【啊……但是，但是我们可是兄妹呀……？】 我喜欢你……就算是兄妹……我也对你………… 我妄想自己扶着阴茎，在出香柔软的处女穴中突刺，妄想她里面被我灌入满满精液的样子。 【不要，不要……！呜哇、呀啊……❤！被，被出久哥哥中出了……❤呜呜、要怀孕了…………】 出香只能喘息，无个性的她毫无还手之力，就算不情愿也只能被我这个哥哥压在身下，摇晃着那对丰满的乳房，立着乳头，两腿大开露出不知廉耻的被我插到不断滴落蜜汁的小穴，娇喘连连。被操开之后她就愈发湿润，不管是眼睛还是下面的小穴。然后她就开始祈求我温柔一些，或者求我的阴茎更加地用力地干她。 出香…… 我喜欢你。 我喜欢你。 ……我爱你。 【唔噫❤出、出香也……喜欢哥哥……最喜欢哥哥了…………】 啊，天堂吧。 我再一次迎来高潮。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*虽然话被无情地打断但是光一没有一丝迟疑，立刻扑了上去，搂住剛的腰，准确找到对方的唇深深地吻了下去。 年轻人之间的冲动就像是一场午夜的篝火，激烈而不知疲倦。因为剛轻轻地叫痛光一才注意到自己这个姿势压下来让剛的小腿被折到了身后，连忙道歉，手附上剛的小腿来回安抚，但是逐渐抚摸就变了味道。 光一的手顺着剛的短裤腿一路伸进去抓住了剛的阴茎，卷起来的裤腿都堆在了腰间，剛轻轻摆弄着身体说不舒服但是光一没有一点松开的意思，练舞时总会被指责的双手现在却灵活无比，不断挑逗着身下人的敏感带。 舌尖也没有放过剛的意思，上衣早都不知所踪，一只手在下面活动着，另一只手则配合着，不停在剛身上留下痕迹。 光一最近最喜欢留痕迹的一个地方，剛的下巴后面的阴影处，在这里留下痕迹的话轻易不会被别人发现，而且……看着剛被迫仰起的头，露出的洁白纤长的颈部，这样把最脆弱的部分显示在自己面前的剛……光一觉得自己瞬间要被欲望撑炸，怎么去排解这份躁动不安，只能靠着身下的这具充满年轻活力的身体。 完全被欲望支配了的剛现在想得只有怎么样才能松一口气，光一过于激烈的动作让剛整个人有些应接不暇，被迫抬起的头大口大口喘着气，双眼因为过激的快感蒙上了水汽，抓着光一的肩膀轻轻叫着光一的名字企图得到更温柔的对待，却不知到这样才更激发了对方的兽性。 光一脱掉剛的裤子，把抱枕垫在剛的脑后。终于有了喘息的机会，剛平躺在沙发上想要平息自己不稳的呼吸。 抓住剛的小腿，顺势搭在自己肩上，一只手已经触到了剛的后穴，贪欢的年轻身体比它的主人更诚实地已经开始亲亲啃咬来试探的指尖。 被现在的姿势刺激到羞耻心，剛不安地想要动作却被光一一巴掌拍在屁股上示意安静，瞬间从脸红到脖子，甚至上半身都微微泛红。剛眼睛里含着水光看着光一，用粘腻的声音发出闷哼。 看着身下人动情的样子，剛也差不多到了能接受自己的程度，光一俯下身，轻轻搂住剛，“我进去了……” “套……”剛轻轻推了推光一，但是实在没有一丝力气了。 “下次再说……”话还没说完光一已经把自己忙进了那份紧致里，剛的体温一直比常人高一点，所以被剛包裹着的感觉让自己简直舒服到要呻吟出来。 看了眼剛没有任何痛苦的样子，光一调整自己的姿势慢慢开始动作，从慢到快，从浅到深。 剛感觉自己像是在海面上的一条小船，随着波浪来回飘动完全由不得自己控制，忍不住心底泛起一丝恐惧，伸出手握住光一撑在自己脸颊边的手臂，用被光一的动作搞到颤抖的声音：“小…光……抱着我，抱，抱我……” 听到剛的声音，光一缓了缓身下的动作，看着剛因为快感而泛红的眼角，就着插在剛体内的姿势把剛一把抱了起来，让剛整个人骑在自己的腿上，脸搭在剛的肩膀上，轻轻吻着剛的脖子，“好了，抱着你，那现在你自己动。” 因为光一忽然停下来而释放不了的欲望让剛更加难过，“不要，不要，要小光，小光……呜嗯……” 叹了一口气，光一拨开剛脸上挡住自己视线的乱发，吻了吻剛的唇，“真是拿你没办法，剛，你很任性诶。” 躲开光一动自己头发的手，剛不满足光一的动作自己摆起腰来，“小光，小光……” 带着鼻音的恋人的呼唤让光一瞬间呼吸变得粗重，一把箍住剛的腰，下身用力向上顶去，加快了动作频率的瞬间剛就只剩下破碎的呻吟。 剛一把抱住光一的肩膀，好让自己稳住不被光一的动作撞到一边，趴在光一的肩上，不断呻吟的同时看着眼前光一的耳垂，玩心大起，一口叼了上去用舌尖轻轻舔弄着，鼻息全部喷在对方的耳廓上。 看到光一这半边身子以肉眼看见的速度泛红，自己都快被做到喘不上气也要把零碎的笑声吐出来。 “剛……” 扶在光一身上一脸无辜地看着对方，“怎么了？欧，尼，酱。” 光一的眸色瞬间变得深沉。 剛还没反应过来的瞬间保持着自己下半身还含着光一的姿势就被翻了个身，整个人趴在沙发靠背上。 光一立刻就贴了上来，手臂环住剛的脖子，另一只手 搂着剛的腰，用尽全力在剛身上开始冲刺。 “堂本剛，你今晚不要想着睡了。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*秦子墨上地铁的时候就感觉有点奇怪。  虽然地铁上平时也是人挤人，但今天站在后面的大叔离他尤其的近。  是错觉吧……他这样想着。  地铁上晃晃悠悠的免不了一些肢体接触，后面老有什么东西顶着他的屁股秦子墨也没当回事，直到后面大叔的手沿着雪白的大腿一路摸进了百褶裙里面。  “！！”秦子墨想叫出声，可是嘴里被大叔的手指塞得满满的，只能呜咽着来回扭动身体。  大叔的手隔着内裤揉着秦子墨鼓鼓囊囊的小屁股，坏心眼的在臀缝之间来回摩擦，隔着一层柔软的布料指奸他窄小的后穴。  秦子墨吓坏了，小穴却被大叔玩弄出了淫水，大叔像得到了鼓励一样把另一只手伸到了他的胸前，揉捏着他小小的乳房。  “叔叔……不要……求求你……”嘴巴终于没有东西塞住，秦子墨小声讨饶：“叔叔我还是第一次……”  “不想被所有人都听到就乖乖让我操。”男人低沉的声音不带一点温度，一只手灵巧的把秦子墨的底裤褪到了膝盖。  “不要…叔叔……”秦子墨怕的眼泪汪汪：“我想把第一次给我喜欢的人……”  男人没理他，一手玩弄着他的乳头，另一只手直接将两根手指插进了后穴里，秦子墨刚刚分化，胸部还没有发育，乳头却敏感的不行，等到两个乳头都被玩了一遍，后穴像发大水了一样，把男人整个手掌都打湿了。  “这么淫荡？”男人笑他。  “子墨，子墨才不淫荡……”秦子墨难耐的想要逃跑，却被捏着男根动弹不得。  男人的手指在他后穴里来回抽插寻找着敏感点，终于在摸到一点的时候秦子墨像一尾离了水的鱼一样抽搐了一下。  “是这里吗？”男人附在他耳边小声问他。  “子墨不知道…嗯……啊…”  男人用力在那一点顶弄，秦子墨第一次被玩弄后穴的敏感处，难受得一直掉眼泪又不敢叫出声，才被插了几分钟就呜咽着射了出来。  男人啧了一声，用力拧了一下他的乳首，“这么快就射了。”  男人把性器在秦子墨腿缝中蹭了一会，秦子墨的后穴已经被手指操的潮湿又柔软，男人性器顶着秦子墨未经人事的花穴，“叔叔要给你的小穴开苞了。”  “不要，叔叔，不要…啊啊……”秦子墨啜泣着摇头，双腿忍不住颤抖着想要夹紧，又被男人用力掰开。  秦子墨感觉到男人粗大的性器慢慢把他的小穴整个贯穿，初承雨露的小穴撕裂的疼痛，小小的乳头被捏在男人的手上来回揉弄。秦子墨从来没有过这样的经历，只能由着男人插在自己的小穴里被欺负的直哭。  “你现在已经是叔叔的女人了。”男人把性器全部插进了秦子墨还没发育好的窄小后穴里：“叔叔的东西把你里面都塞满了。”  “子墨，子墨是男孩子……”秦子墨眼泪汪汪的辩解。  “男孩子怎么穿着百褶裙？小穴里还这么湿？嗯？”男人坏心眼的在他穴里用力顶弄。  “因为…因为……”秦子墨被操得又疼又爽，只能抽抽搭搭的抹眼泪，连句完整的话都说不出来。  男人在秦子墨的敏感点上研磨，秦子墨难受的想要逃开，却无意中把小屁股撅的更高，像是在勾引男人进入。后穴被性器彻底撑开，里面满满的酸胀又舒服。  “叔叔别插那里了…呜…好难受……啊……子墨射不出来了……”秦子墨打了个哭嗝，被插得无力抵抗只能承受着身后男人的玩弄。嫩红的处子穴被男人粗大的性器操得充血红肿，秦子墨感觉自己的身板都要被男人弄散架了。  “乖，自己把生殖腔打开，给叔叔生个孩子。”男人放过秦子墨的敏感处，又在他的宫颈口处一下下的用力顶撞。  “不要…叔叔……子墨好疼……啊啊……不要……求求叔叔不要顶开子墨的子宫…好疼……子墨不要怀孕……子墨要上学………”  秦子墨越是哭泣求饶男人越用力顶弄他那处，借着淫水使劲操着他的小穴，敏感的宫颈口被插得疼痛难忍，秦子墨像是被玩坏的玩具，最终在男人怀里着颤抖着潮吹。  秦子墨潮吹失神的时候生殖腔也终于彻底打开，滑腻的肠液喷溅在两人的交合处。男人不顾秦子墨刚刚高潮之后敏感的身子，在秦子墨体内放肆的抽插着。  “唔…好涨……子墨要被叔叔玩坏了……叔叔饶了子墨吧……”秦子墨涎水不受控制的从嘴角溢出。  “被叔叔操怀孕就饶了你，好不好？”男人用指甲刮着秦子墨脆弱的乳孔，粗暴的玩弄着。  “好……被叔叔……操怀孕…呜……给叔叔生宝宝……”  “叔叔这就射进来了。”  “啊啊……！被叔叔……射进肚子里了……”秦子墨僵着身子，被操得又射了出来。  高潮了好几次的秦子墨彻底没了力气，身后靖佩瑶没有立刻把自己那物抽出来，而是借着摇晃的地铁又狠狠撞进了秦子墨的里面。  “不行了…呜…要被哥哥操穿了…”秦子墨难耐的挣扎，靖佩瑶这才放过他。  靖佩瑶一用力把秦子墨搂在怀里，掰过秦子墨的小脸和他接吻，被玩弄的肿大了一倍的乳头轻轻一碰秦子墨就疼得哭着往靖佩瑶怀里钻。  “瑶哥，回家吧。”秦子墨脸上还带着没退下的薄红，困得眼神迷蒙的靠在靖佩瑶怀里：“好累呀。”  “乖。”  ——————————fin——————————  又是整个地铁的人都瞎系列，我再也不乱写了。（下跪 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*我没想过子墨会是双性人。 但不管是从不同于同龄人的幼齿嗓音，又细又软的腰，还是对于男人来说过于圆润挺翘的屁股，都让他下面多出个花穴这件事变得有情可原。  双性人的性欲要比普通人强很多，这是我不知道第几次撞破他在浴室里自慰之后得出的结论。  “需要我帮忙吗？” 他满脸无辜也不答话，只是大眼睛湿漉漉的望着我。 我叹了口气，把他抱回了房间。  这已经不是我第一次和他做这种事。 说是帮忙，其实不过是互相解决生理需求，床上伉俪情深，下床还是普通同事。     他衣衫不整的被我扔在床上，T恤下的两个乳头被他玩的红肿挺立着，把t恤衫撑起了两个小点。我隔着那层不算厚的布料摁住乳头用指腹磨蹭，又恶趣味的用两个手指掐着被蹭到兴奋充血挺立的乳珠来回拉扯玩弄，这两天被过度亵玩的奶头承受不住这么厉害的刺激，小兔子又爽又疼难受的厉害，不住地小声求饶，直到被欺负的颤着身子高潮我才把他放开。  “只是这样就高潮了吗。” 可能每一个无口系男子内心都藏着一个抖S魂，我平时有多不舍得看他掉眼泪，就有多喜欢在床上弄哭他。他像是一只傻乎乎的小兔子，心甘情愿的掉进猎人的陷阱里。 就算刚刚被我欺负的泪眼朦胧，雪白的手臂下一秒又依赖的圈住我的臂膀。圆鼓鼓的小屁股缓缓磨蹭着我的下体，又是害羞又是期待的看着我。 “瑶哥下面…好硬。”  我拍拍他的屁股，他会意的乖乖脱掉内裤，分开自己的双腿。 他在床上很听话，像一只温顺的小动物，像是被干的乱七八糟也要努力艰难地挺起腰臀配合我抽插的可怜幼兔。 手指抵着阴蒂滑进小穴下流的搅动。刚刚高潮过的敏感下体紧紧地吸吮着我的手指，透明的淫液随着手指流了出来，小兔子被刺激的想要加紧双腿，又被我掰开。 “听话。” 无论被插入多少次，激烈的玩弄都让他忍不住腿根颤栗着小声的抽泣，贪婪地沉溺在灭顶的快感中。 “要被…弄坏了……”子墨又是欢愉又是痛苦的急促的喘息着，“瑶哥…好厉害…瑶哥……” 被插到发烫的湿滑内壁温顺的含着在里面施虐的男根。 “让哥哥把你这里玩坏好不好？” 子墨被干得泪眼朦胧，脑子也没有办法思考，只能顺从的回答我的话：“呜……好……哥哥玩坏子墨……” 我脱掉他的t恤衫，他乳头可怜的挺立着，被玩弄过度的变成了艳红色。 “好疼……” 子墨用乳尖来回磨蹭着我的手指，仿佛祈求着疼爱。 我轻轻捏弄了几下，他难受得直掉眼泪。  有时候操的狠了，他会眼泪涟涟的边打着哭嗝边软软的求哥哥温柔一点，所有的男人都会差点被他纯情的双眼欺骗。但不管多过分的情事，他最后都会在我怀里颤抖着潮吹，像是在祈求着进一步的凌虐。 明明是个软绵绵的小兔子，却喜欢在床上被粗暴的对待，喜欢身上遍布青青青紫的痕迹，喜欢被抽打腿根和屁股，喜欢奶头被玩弄到红肿发烫，穿衣服时候会疼的扑进我怀里撒娇掉眼泪，但是下次还是会害羞的挺起小小的胸脯任由抚弄亵玩。  我坏心眼的在他濒临高潮的时候慢了下来，每一下都狠狠地撞在他的子宫口。 “不要……啊……瑶哥……哪里不行……呜……”他难耐的挺腰，又不想逃开，奶猫似的撒娇示弱：“哥哥……好疼……抱抱我嘛……” 我把他抱进怀里安抚，身下的欲望却进的更深，小猫窝在我怀里被插得惨兮兮的到了高潮。  子墨累得把脸埋进我肩窝里小声喘息，“里面好疼……” “继续吗？还是再休息一会儿？”我亲昵的碰碰他的鼻尖。 “继续吧…瑶哥还没…” 手指分开他的花穴，蚌肉一样不住地开合抽搐着，又缓缓进入了他的子宫。看他咬着瓷白的手臂强忍住哭泣，后仰着柔韧的躯体，羔羊一样乖巧的承受着粗暴的给予。 我把他的手臂拿开，“难受就咬我。” 他颤抖着摇摇头，“哥哥明天还有工作……” 我心里一软，凑过去亲他，“没关系。”  我能感觉到他柔软稚嫩的宫颈紧紧的包裹着我的下身，他不知道该怎么才能调整出正确的姿势缓解体内难耐的涨痛，只能门户大开的由着我操弄。 他到底还是没有咬我，抓着身下的床单哽咽着再次高潮。  高潮时不住痉挛的内壁夹得我也要忍不住，在紧窄的花穴最后用力抽插了几下，拔出来射在了他的小腹上。     我抽出来的时候听见他轻轻地痛哼了一声，我安抚的摸着他的后颈，“还疼吗？” “呜…” 我亲了亲他的发顶，“子墨好乖。” 他窝在我怀里委委屈屈的撒娇：“想要奖励。” 我捏捏他的鼻尖，“比如？” 他没说话，像只粘人的小猫似的搂住我的脖子，不由分说的亲了上来，我先是一愣，随后也就由着他胡闹。 “多谢款待。”他分开时候调皮的舔舔我的嘴唇，眼睛亮亮的笑得狡黠。 “只是这样？” “不然咧。” “没什么，”我摆摆手，“感觉很像情侣。” 子墨一下子脸红到耳根，急急忙忙把头埋进被子里，“我累啦，瑶哥晚安。” 我揉揉他露在被子外面毛茸茸的头顶，“晚安。”     在我快睡着的时候他悄悄地钻进我被子里，我就顺手把他搂进了怀里。 他像个做坏事被抓包的小孩子，“瑶哥你没睡着呀…” “还没，怎么了。” “喔…”他小声说：“哥哥下次射进我里面吧。” 我忍不住笑了，这傻小子。 “睡吧。”     ——————————fin———————————— *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Wherein Thomas gives James' body the attention it deserves. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*James’ thighs were a thing of beauty, a wonder of God’s creation, solid and firm and thick as pillars of the world. As such, they received Thomas’ grateful appreciation as often as the situation presented itself. James’ arse was equally magnificent, a treasure made flesh.  James, oddly bashful creature that he is, won’t often allow Thomas to take his time to properly express his reverence for that part of James’s body. A most peculiar blush will consume him if Thomas says a single word about it. Thomas knows that’s not the only way to worship James’ arse using his mouth. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*已经被粘液润湿的小穴饥渴的翕弄，挤出将后穴涨的满满的密液。上鸣故作经验老道的扶着切岛挺立的性器，缓缓的将头部吞入。才刚没入几分，被满足的舒适感太过强烈，却是上鸣先软了腿，一脱力直接将性器吞没至底端。  切岛几乎是遵从本能的挺腰耸动，饶是他也没想到上鸣在实战这方面......的确很弱。  “嗯啊......不要.......我想......看着你.......”上鸣仰着头靠在切岛的肩上，劲瘦的腰被切岛揽在臂间，左腿的膝弯也被切岛勾着叠在胸前。穴口的媚肉层层缠绕着吮吸深埋于其中的性器，被抚过的每一处都火热异常。上鸣的身子被顶的上下颠簸，想要将双腿闭合却被切岛再度强硬的分开。  淫靡的水声夹杂着肉体碰撞的声音在房内回荡，臊的上鸣全身都仿佛染上了一层红。所幸男高的房间不存在俗名为镜子的物件，否则上鸣定会看到他泛着潮红的脸和迷离的眼神，被掰开的双腿之间已经被肏的红熟的肉穴还恬不知耻的吞吐着肆虐的巨物。  “唔啊啊......太快......太快了......呜......”即使是从下至上的抽送，切岛的速度依旧未曾收敛。热硬的巨物反复破开紧致的肠肉顶入深处，有力的磨过敏感的内壁。上鸣的理智近乎被烧成的灰烬，切岛从背后情色的舔舐的舔着他的耳垂。上鸣的腰弓起，反扣着切岛已经被拧皱的T恤，前端甚至还未得到抚慰就已经涌出一股股的白精。  “上鸣......你咬的太紧了......”切岛咬着上鸣后颈的软肉，肠肉将他的欲拒还迎的缠着他的硬物，随着高潮的那一阵绞紧咬的切岛的呼吸都沉重了几分。就着性器还埋在体内的姿势，他带着上鸣侧着身一个翻转，引来恶魔一阵难耐的呜咽。  高潮后疲软的物件被轻柔的抚弄，魅魔自身散发的香气若有若无的弥漫在房间，切岛的脑子也被烧的迷迷糊糊。手下几乎是不由自主的撸弄，抚平其上的褶皱，不时用指尖抠弄上端渗水的小孔。脆弱敏感的囊袋被火热的手指触碰，激的上鸣舒服的从唇中挤出几句低哼。  切岛的手逐渐沿着腰线上移，魅魔几乎全身都是敏感点，就连掌心炽热的温度不经意擦过他苍白的皮肤，都能带动上鸣的身子一阵颤栗。充血的两颗小点硬立起来，被切岛的手指无心的拨弄而激的一个哆嗦。  切岛拖着上鸣的腰将性器埋入更深，毫不停歇的抽送将噙满后穴的汁液不断挤出，仿若失禁一般浸湿了床单和交合的部位。上鸣的腿不由自主的将切岛的腰盘紧，即使上身向后挣扎着躲避狂风暴雨的侵犯，穴肉仍是食髓知味的将硬物绞紧，甚至不由自主摆动着腰牵引着切岛去顶弄最要命的那点。矛盾和快感的双重压迫让他快要发疯。  上鸣双手抵着切岛的胸肌，无力的晃着头喃喃。切岛装作顺从的将性器缓缓抽出，媚肉却又蠕动着挽留火热的离去。在尽数抽出之时，切岛腰上又用力向前一顶，将粗长的性器尽数没入，仿佛要捅至最深处。  在意识恍惚之时，尾巴不自觉的缠上切岛的小臂，而上鸣本人似乎毫不自知。  切岛勾着上鸣修长的腿架至肩上，一面用指腹磨搓着那处光滑的肌肤。另一面摁着另一条腿的膝盖扣在腰侧，让不安分的恶魔不再随意折腾。完全受制于切岛的姿势让上鸣几乎将所有的注意集中在身后那处从尾椎直涌而上的快感。  “不就是......是个处男.......”在上鸣的发言愈加恶劣之前，切岛抚着他的面颊含上了上鸣的唇。近乎狂热的啃噬着唇瓣，贪婪的扫过唇腔的每一处，吮弄着火热的唇舌。就着亲吻的频率，巨物依旧大开大合的顶着肠肉。肠道不断被撑开顶入深处，上鸣的手盘着切岛的肩回应着着这抵死的缠绵。泛着水汽的金瞳半眯着，带着几分邪气和魅意。  “呃啊......不要......嗯......变大...了”掌着大腿内侧的手心突然变得坚硬无比，在体内火热的巨大变得更为肿胀，将已经撑到极限的后穴填的满满当当。上鸣侧过头躲避切岛缠绵不休的亲吻，就连切岛自己也不曾发现不知何时顶在脑门上的龙角和攀在肌肤上若隐若现的赤色龙鳞。  “好胀......切岛...嗯啊.......好痛...”连魅魔都承受不了的尺寸，上鸣的眼角发红的抖着身子，即使切岛适时停下了动作，不容忽视的硬物嵌在体内还是让他不舒服的扭着身子。异样的饱足和始终无法满足的空虚交织着袭来，上鸣又不由自主的耸动着腰吞吐着可观的硬物。  性器进入了前所未有的深度，好像要捅穿内脏。软肉被反复的顶弄，上鸣的身子被切岛顶弄的不断向后却又被扣着腰重重的摁回。每一次深入都带动着上鸣的身子不可遏制的颤抖，上鸣觉得自己要被顶穿了，来不及吞咽的涎水顺着嘴角而下浸湿了那一处的床单。  妖族的耐力已经超过了上鸣的想象，他已经哆嗦了身子泄了三次，切岛那一处依旧热硬的慑人。敏感的耳垂被湿润的舌尖舔弄，乳珠也被灵活的指尖反复的搓弄，更别提身后不需要丝毫技巧就被傲人的资本满足的后穴，多面侵来的快感让上鸣连意识都恍惚了。紧缩的后穴好像要将肆虐多时的巨物推出，却始终欲拒还迎的将切岛咬的更紧。  “我...好像要射了...”切岛对着上鸣的敏感点最后几个抽送，才仓皇的想要抽出。上鸣急切的握住切岛的手腕，带着气音和虚虚的喘息，“没关系的......射进来...”  滚烫黏稠的精水尽数涌进了窄小的肉穴，上鸣一个颤栗也随之射了出来，哑着嗓子满足的低哼一声。  切岛将上鸣的腿放下，俯下身将他拥入怀中。一面傻笑一面恶意的尚未完全疲软的性器往里送了几分，带出了几分徘徊在穴口的白灼。  上鸣一瘪嘴狠狠抬头撞向切岛的额头，反被龙族坚硬的鳞甲反伤的痛的不轻。切岛心急的去帮上鸣揉头，结合的部位又断续的涌出几分和着肠液的精水，这下上鸣的表情就有点耐人寻味了。  “你别把我的晚饭带出来啊混蛋！”上鸣几乎是没好气的看着轻柔的用手抚过他的伤口的切岛。  切岛先是愣了愣，反应过来那个爆炸头恶魔告诉他魅魔是靠精液为食......后知后觉之时脸已经涨的通红，舌头打结的连话都说不利索：“就......就这么......堵在...堵在里面吸收吗！”  切岛又小心的将性器赌进去将交合的部位填的严严实实，两边的的臀肉不知是被有意无意的向里拢紧。  上鸣软哼一声，几乎快被切岛气笑了，他侧头将脸埋进枕头里，小声嘟囔了一句：“傻子。”  “嗯。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Their attachment is still new enough that Percy finds himself constantly surprised by John. There’s so much yet they’ve got to share about their pasts, including exactly how —and with whom— John learnt how to use his mouth this way, how he took Percy’s cock down his throat after two, no, three stubborn attempts.   If only they’d had taken the time to light up a few candles Percy would see what John looks like during such an act, so eager and hungry to lose himself on Percy’s flesh. There’ll be time to ask questions later. Now it’s time for bliss. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Castiel twisted his wrists, testing the ropes that kept him secured to the wooden chair on which he sat. There was a little give, but he was definitely restrained. “Too tight?” Dean asked, breath warm on the back of Castiel’s neck. “No, perfect.” “Good.” Dean rose to slip a length of dark silk over Castiel’s eyes. He tied the silk off and everything went dark. The room was silent except for the sound of Dean rummaging through the bag of toys he’d set on the bed earlier. Then Castiel heard him move to stand in front of him. “Let’s begin.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*无论耳畔的告白如何甜蜜炙热，呼吸间散发的荷尔蒙如何浓烈迷人，即使自然法则把男女欢好视为理所当然，把肌肤相贴的颤栗看作锦上添花，来回出入史蒂芬妮体内的肉刃带来的却只有难捱的恐惧与窒息。  以及她不愿承认的无上快感。  男人的指尖在阴道口轻轻打转，微不可察的抚弄如同隔靴搔痒，尖叫声被紧闭的嘴唇推回喉间，化成奶猫无助的呜咽，甜腻到可怜。她企图挣脱腰间有力的小臂，将想要更进一步的手指紧紧夹在滑腻柔软的腿根间，抗拒养父情色意味十足的触摸，挪动着远离却又因为重心不稳适得其反，跌倒在雪松味的怀抱中。  自投罗网。  “哇哦，感受到了吗？史蒂薇，它在动…”手指从原本夹紧的双腿间抽出，托尼索性彻底扯掉小女儿膝上碍事的布料，像目盲之人触碰花圃里最娇艳的玫瑰，缓慢又细致地游走在那片秘密之地，甜美诱人的花心被掩盖在湿淋淋的花瓣间，与绯色唇瓣一起颤抖着，正待采撷。  “别……别碰那里……唔……”史蒂芬妮光裸的双腿被弯折成M型，来自阴蒂的强烈刺激让她无力地歪倒在男人怀里任其鱼肉。依旧动人的月光隐匿在窗外繁茂枝叶之间变幻成黯淡细微的光斑。海上烟火腾空，欢欣的绿色星火映在瞳仁之上，不过短暂一刻又坠落在眼睑下尚未干涸的泪痕里。  “你是daddy的乖女孩吗？你喜欢daddy这样对你……嗯？”男人继续加大揉弄阴蒂的力度，无论是第一次，还是这一次，史蒂芬妮最终总会在他怀中绷紧双腿，哭喊扭动着喷水，那些带着些许腥气的液体从粉红色的柔嫩洞口中喷出，弄脏整个沙发，真是个坏女孩。  “不……不要……啊……不……”女孩在养父的玩弄下惊叫着潮吹，阴蒂上的麻痒蔓延至整个阴阜，层叠推进的快感像岸边卷起的白色浪花，打湿小腿，迷迷糊糊又温柔，尽管那只是几秒的欢愉。史蒂芬妮背对着男人，单侧脸颊贴上柔软的皮草垫子，她厌恶自己在违背伦常的性爱里轻易被情欲击倒，仅仅被几根手指玩到高潮，又无法挣脱陷阱，迷失在自我厌恶的死循环里。  她曾幻想身上是其他人，可惜只有托尼占有过史蒂芬妮的全部，虚构的陌生角色甚至无法在脑海里成型。  “那小子叫什么？我想想……彼得！他怎么样？”托尼坚硬火热的性器贴近臀缝摩擦着，女孩的胸衣被高高推到颈边年轻丰美的躯体赤裸地趴卧在沙发上，他浑不在意地揉搓着面团一样松软的乳房，语调平缓，仿佛只是在说今晚的月色。  “你用身体去安慰他受伤的心灵吗？甜心，用你的手去碰他，你不该这样……”  温热的嘴唇贴在她的蝴蝶骨上，男人叹息着握紧养女的右手，他心爱的史蒂芬妮，上帝用水晶，珍珠和蜜桃做成的小公主，她不该被任何除他以外的男人触碰，那些猥琐，愚蠢的动物，连一丝呼吸都不该接近。  “daddy给你的关注还不够多吗？甜心，你知道我有多爱你，你一直知道，戴上这手环看看……”  他在生日那天也蹭趴在史蒂芬妮身上，将咸腥的精液一波又一波地进女孩娇嫩脆弱的子宫里，细密炙热的亲吻停留在右脚腕上，留下铬银色的圆环。精致简约的成年礼绝不仅是装饰品一般简单，那更像是犯人的镣铐，每次反抗换来的只有切肤之痛以及深入神经与肌肉间蛮横的掌控。  “不，不要……住手，托尼——啊！”直呼其名实在是个错误的决定，那根粗壮火热的阳具直接破开穴口插进阴道，龟头顶端甚至差点顶进宫口。她的腕骨几乎要被男人捏碎，最终金属的冰冷还是贴上了肌肤。  “不要什么？因为彼得？你这么迫不及待地想要他爱上你，想要试试男童的鸡巴？饥渴的小婊子，假惺惺地讲什么爸爸教你骑自行车，我只教你骑过我的阴茎，满 口谎言！”他将阳具从阴道抽出，复又狠命地插进去，相当满意女孩唇间溢出的喘息与呻吟。  “看看手环上的点缀，史蒂芬妮，哦，我们需要点光。”  客厅瞬间亮如白昼，钻石贴着奶油色的肌肤投出璀璨明艳的色泽。  “我还把沙发换成了你最喜欢的薰衣草紫，告诉daddy喜欢吗？”  “你不是我daddy！你是谁！放开我！”史蒂芬妮惊慌地尖叫起来，满眼的紫色是生日那天地板上散乱铺开的枝条，也是在那一刻，她失去了托尼斯塔克曾许诺的陪伴与自由，黑暗与错乱入侵了世界上最温暖的内心。  “宝贝儿，我当然是你的daddy，不过我马上也是他的daddy了。” 托尼的笑意依旧挂在脸上。  毫无温度的掌心贴上女孩依旧平坦的小腹。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*杨九郎换好睡衣回卧室的，本躺在床上乖顺的张云雷没了踪影。屋子里拉了粉色的窗帘儿，墙壁上不知道什么时候被张云雷贴了星星壁灯一闪一闪的，俨然东京小黄片儿的拍摄现场。浴室里哗啦哗啦的响着水声，杨九郎躺床上试探的喊了声磊磊里头也没言语，翻个身拿手机看张云雷明天拍完杂志之后的工作安排，正看着呢就觉得身后被一股湿热的气息包围了，又翻过身正好儿把身后系着猫尾巴的张云雷抱了个满怀。     “磊磊这是腰不疼了？”     “跟哥哥的性福比起来，磊磊不怕腰疼。”     张云雷媚眼如丝的跨坐在杨九郎身上，慢慢儿的俯下身子去摸这人肚子上的肌肉。杨九郎瘦下来之后一直跟着烧饼健身房轰趴，明显的有了腹肌，张云雷像只发现新大陆的猫儿一样伸舌头去舔杨九郎的腹肌，濡湿的舌头一下儿一下儿的轻轻扫过，勾的人心里痒。没舔够似的又亲又啃的在人锁骨上留恋，不时的从嗓子眼儿里泄了哼唧声出来，杨九郎直jio的药丸，起反应了。张云雷猜着人心思一样慢慢儿的往下褪，嘴巴叼着人的裤边儿往下扯了大半截儿，爱人的大宝贝儿直挺挺的向自个儿敬了礼，张云雷也没顾的杨九郎的表情，隔着内裤去摸杨九郎的小兄弟，觉得热的发烫的时候才覆了温热的唇上去，舌头一点一点的描着小九郎的形状，杨九郎扣住了张云雷的后脑勺舒服的嗯了一声。张云雷褪了杨九郎的内裤，重新含住了杨九郎的小兄弟，舌尖扫过柱头轻轻吸了吸，跟被逗乐了的猫儿一样更卖力的吞吐着人的巨物，杨九郎环着人的后脑勺仰了脖子哼了声向上挺挺腰给人来了几次深喉，张云雷被顶的眼角泛了红死死的抓着人的腿嘴里发了呜咽声，杨九郎没有要停的意思反而更加卖力的顶着，湿热的精液留在人嘴里的时候才自知自己犯了混翻身去床头拿了纸抽坐到人身边。     “磊磊快吐了，是老公不好。”     张云雷跪在床上抬眼看了人，摇了摇头又滚了滚喉结把精液咽进了肚子里，在杨九郎诧异的眼神下软了身子躺在人大腿上，伸手环了人的腰。     “磊磊想给哥哥生个孩子。”     杨九郎眼底挂了温柔，俯下身去吻人的嘴唇，张云雷顺势勾住人脖子，慢慢儿的被人压在了身下，舌头探进人的口腔里交换了一个绵长的法式舌吻。杨九郎空出手去抚摸人胸前的红樱，指腹缓缓的滑过乳头，又用两指指缝夹住，时轻时重的揉捏，看着乳头慢慢变得挺立红肿才松开了张云雷的唇，脑袋埋在人胸前去啃另一颗红樱，像真的能嘬出奶似的使劲嘬着，濡湿的舌头舔着乳头。张云雷把腿搭在杨九郎的腰上，手抱着人的头咬紧了嘴唇却还是泄出了嗯嗯啊啊的声。     “乖，别咬着嘴唇。”     重新覆上那人的唇，仔细研磨着，伸了胳膊去捞床头的润滑。一面与人缠在一起的抱着一面又把润滑挤在手里，仔细捂热了才伸手托着人屁股伸了根手指进人小穴，意料之中的被人攀紧了脖子。看着人的反应又慢慢儿的加了手指进去，捻着人的敏感点不断的摁压，身下的小孩儿硬生生的被逼出了泪儿才仰着脖子叫出了声儿。     “哥哥，进来吧。”     杨九郎这会子倒犯起了坏，凑过去亲亲人的嘴角，抓了人身后绑的尾巴就往人刚刚扩张好留着一片潮湿的后穴塞，碾到敏感点了才停下。一手捏着人的尾巴动，一手把早备好的震动棒也一并塞进了人的后穴，看着身下人无助的样子才玩味的笑笑低头含住人的唇，张云雷的呜咽和嘤咛声一并的吞进了肚子里。压在人的敏感点上一下下刺激着张云雷，双腿把杨九郎的腰夹的愈发紧，指甲在人的后背上划出了几道又细又长的印子。     “磊磊？想要吗？”     “老公，操操…操操你的小媳妇儿吧，啊！”     “老公今儿，正面上磊磊吧。”     张云雷握住了杨九郎的胳膊，腿自觉的搭在了人的肩膀上，小穴被震动棒和尾巴磨得红肿不堪，床单上也湿了一大片。抵在小穴的东西猛的被抽走，大片的空虚感袭来，张云雷倒没了性子索性直接坐起身来紧紧的贴着人的胸膛，后穴慢慢的吞了杨九郎的分身，一起一伏的动了起来。杨九郎看张云雷这样喜欢的紧，一手托着人屁股又顺势把人没受伤的腿搭在肩膀上好让自己进的更深些。张云雷被人欺负的脱了力，搂着人的腰赖赖的软人怀里随着人动。杨九郎自然是看出了人的心思，把人放平在床上，小心翼翼的把人的另一条腿搭在肩膀上，杨九郎半跪在床上三浅两深的去碾人的敏感点却又迟迟不完全碾到那里。     “宝贝儿，我们三浅两深的喊我爱你，嗯？”     张云雷也顾不得什么礼义廉耻，只胡乱点了头由着杨九郎动作。     “我…我爱你，啊我啊…我爱你！老公，这个，好深啊！”     “翔子我爱你，啊…还要顶啊！”     “宝贝儿我也爱你，你看对面儿镜子里头你是不是很好看？”     张云雷这才知道杨九郎为什么执意要在卧室里挂一面大镜子，好么跟这儿等着他呢。抬头看了一眼，斥着粉色的屋子里自己满是情欲的环着人的耳垂儿亲，愣生生的被羞了个大红脸儿躲进了杨九郎怀里。感觉自己要到的时候才伸手握住张云雷的分身上下撸动着，前后夹击的快感让张云雷的嘤咛声更肆意，杨九郎在张云雷耳边低低的吼了一声也释放在了人体内。     “老公，抱我洗洗去吧，磊磊好困了。”     张云雷懒了身子瘫在床上，杨九郎同他抱了会儿又反复亲了亲人的嘴角才把他抱去浴室。抱着清清爽爽的张云雷从浴室出来的时候窗外忽的下了大雨，雨珠拍在窗户上噼啪乱响。张云雷不明所以的往人怀里拱了拱。     “老公。”     “乖，没事。睡吧。晚安。”     杨九郎搂紧了人顺势捂了人的耳朵，张云雷也伸手环住了杨九郎的腰，扯了一个甜腻的笑窝人怀里睡去了。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The wolf that lives in the forest requires the village to send him a sacrifice. Red is the unfortunate choice. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Red is first bathed in a milk white bath that smells like the last days of summer and is then robed in a garment that barely covers her modesty, so light the gentlest breeze could pull it from her shoulders, and a band of thicker fabric is secured around her eyes.  Red knows her modesty is not important tonight. She knows it won't be the wind that undresses her. She knows she won't want to see what does, won't want to feel what comes afterwards.  She is taken by the arm by an unseen hand and she is walked. Her bare feet go over cobblestones, then grass. They stop at the edge of the woods.  "You'll go into the forest as far as you can and wait," a man's voice. "The wolf will find you."  And because Red is ready for this, because she has already cried all her tears over it, she goes blindly forward into the woods and leaves her old life behind her.  She walks until her feet ache too much to go on.  She waits until finally she hears his footsteps, feels hot breath at her neck, and knows her monster has found her at last. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The roses needed pruning, and John was glad of an excuse to slap the shears shut with force, again and again, working up a sweat at his temples. Grunting annoyance more than effort.  Sherlock’s long arms came around him from behind, hands spidery against his chest, and though John drew himself up tight and straight, telegraphing his anger through his posture, he did not lean away. Sherlock’s chest against his back was too warm, too close. Too soon.  The tip of Sherlock’s nose dipped into the hair at his temple, and no doubt he felt the perspiration there, and John hoped it repelled him.  “My words were poorly chosen,” Sherlock soothed. It was a start, but John wouldn’t let him off easily.  “Indeed they were,” he huffed.  Sherlock’s hands moved. His lips brushed the top edge of John’s ear.  “I wasn’t thinking.”  “Were you not?”  “You know–I hope you know–I would never intentionally cause you pain.”  Sherlock nudged with cheek and chin, and John bared his throat for his lips, soft sucking kisses in a winding trail.  John sighed, not with pleasure.  “Forgive me.”  A moment. A kiss.  “Of course.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Every inch of him lit up and singing–stinging–burning red that feels bright white. Every melting muscle oozing out the strain of stillness,  just so , the involuntary flinch that pulls him taut and shames him (he shouldn’t fight; wants to be supple, bent, bowing low in breaking surrender). Flaring. Throbbing. Raw and tender and superheated. On his knees. Shoulders fallen. Head hanging, and he pants to catch his breath, and at once the utter shock of fingers gentle about his chin, murmured praise against his mouth, damp lips pressing between his own. A different kind of cruelty, throwing him askew. So soft. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Two fugitives build something together... *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Shaak Ti struggled, sending the pain into the Force. Her legs open, she leaned down on her lover’s bulk.  The egg seemed so much bigger right now, weighing down on her birth canal, that it had seemed on the scanner. And there were three of them, almost spherical.  Three, and all of them were a terrible idea. Two fugitives, one from the Empire, the other from the people who engineered him to hunt him, deciding to have Younglings…  Two fugitives from different species!  She didn’t even know she could reproduce by oviposition, but when she had felt in the Force the sparks of life inside herself…  Tosk wiped down her montrals. With a last exhausted whimper, Shaak Ti expulsed the first egg: he caught it and put him in the nest they had prepared. It was blue, almost luminescent, and she could see the silhouette of their child inside.  “They won’t be Tosk,” He affirmed, caressing tenderly the fragile shell. Even after the death of her all people, the fact that his creators had given him  Prey  for name still outraged her. She put her hand in his.  “They won’t be Tosk,” She promised, then she started to push again. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*小肉餅系列第二發 今天的作者依然腎疼！ *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*当朱一龙回到住宿的地方时，他没想到会收到这麽热情的大礼。两个人挤在狭窄的门口热切的拥吻着，头上微黄的小灯亮着，光线把白宇的眼睫毛映出一片阴影，看起来倒一点不输朱一龙的，他熟练地伸向对方的金属皮扣，不但没有被人急切的吮咬吓着，反倒是用低沉戏谑的声音朝人耳边吹了口气。「龙哥，这麽急啊？可别等会儿还没干上就走火了。」 闻言朱一龙只是微微抽开身，朝得瑟的不知天高地厚的小孩眯了眯眼，接着趁白宇反应不及的情况下大手一捞，竟硬是把跟自己差不多身高的人抱了起来。 「噢霍？龙哥？哎、等等，别、哎呦我去。」不知道该庆幸两人默契太好还是紧张屁股底下那火热的形状，白宇反射性的就把两长腿往上一勾，稳稳地盘在朱一龙腰间，他瞄了眼身后发现对方走去的方向似乎有张King Size大床，感觉自己要凉凉的白宇吞了吞口水连声讨饶卖乖起来，却只得到被一股脑摔进床上的待遇。 「小白，你怎麽这麽皮。」朱一龙俯瞰着身下的小孩，脸上挂着笑手上的动作却一点也不留情，几乎是粗鲁地一把掀起人的衣服下襬，往上一捲俐落地绕了几圈就把白宇的双手捆住，而”受害者”也笑嘻嘻地由着他龙哥，他想毕竟两人都好一阵子没见着，来点情趣也无所谓──几个小时后的白宇只想穿越回来打死这个不知死活的自己。 然而此刻的白宇还有閒情逸致地欣赏朱一龙的脱衣秀，当对方露出精实的腹部与两条白晰长腿时，他心裡那股痒意又冒出头，遵从本心的90后用上标准的流氓调戏黄花大闺女的模样，朝人吹了口哨子，附带用赤裸的脚掌，隔着薄薄的布料踩上那处肿胀，半轻半重的摩娑按压起来。 「小小龙真精神呀，还不让大爷我瞧瞧。」 直到这时靠着床头灯，朱一龙才注意到白宇的下半身是裸着的，想起刚才闻到的皂香及那股淡淡水气，这小孩倒是胆越来越肥，不就是仗着自己最后还是会让着他，但孰可忍孰不可忍，既然都是成年人那谁撩起的火就该谁负责，他扣住对方那只不安分的脚往上一放，直接架在肩头，并把人另一条腿用力摁住，听见白宇发出声闷哼，比起不适更多的还是下体暴露人前的羞赧，朱一龙心裡笑着对方来得太慢的羞耻心，却同时也为此更硬上几分。朱一龙弯下身再度咬上白宇明显的锁骨，空出手掏出性器贴上彼此的，情动地来回顶弄，并满意地察觉对方同样的兴奋。 「小不小你不知道？要不今天让你再长长记性。」 白宇粗喘着气不断想将自己的阴茎撞向对方，但苦于双腿被人禁锢着无法动弹，听见男人的话他把双手勾上人脖子，不顾自己半条腿还高举着就用力一带，两人的身躯贴得更近几分，白宇发出声难耐又憋扭的抽气声，他用力的咬了上去，最终却还是顾忌着朱一龙后续的工作，把落点从嘴唇改到肩膀上。 「哥哥，操我。」 朱一龙从未听过如此明目张胆又极具诱惑力的话，像是把全世界最好的糖一口气塞到他跟前，甜的几乎要齁死人的那种，又像是他过去见过的蔚蓝海洋，幽深神祕的世界让他情不自禁地一次次揹着气瓶往下潜，听着耳边传来遥远而未知的声响。但是白宇不同，朱一龙心想。他愿意溺死在每一次对视的眼神中，愿意像虔诚的信徒，用每一个吻献上自己的满腔爱意，永不后悔。 朱一龙再也忍不住，他像个初次开荤的小鬼般慌不择路地探向那处穴口，却惊讶的发现不是想像中的乾涩紧緻，手指轻易探入柔软湿热的入口，他抬眼望去，白宇的眼睛在月光下亮如星辰又深如黑夜，他听见对方说着含煳不清的短句，最清晰的还是那声──哥哥。   ─────吃吃龙哥的大锅巴！！─────   隔天朱一龙醒来，发现原本应该在床上歇息的某个傢伙换上轻鬆的灰色上衣、咖啡色短裤盘腿坐在全身镜前自拍，他好奇的凑过去趴到人身后，懒洋洋地看对方仔细地在照片上马赛克，自己先前特意订的民宿倒是派上了用场，除了某张照片一角露出的行李箱，从其他来看倒像是在家裡的自拍似的，看着白宇发了微博，他抬手环抱住自己的小孩，像是自言自语般说道。 「小白，你让我怎麽办才好。」 「现在这样，就挺好。」 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Mm~ I think I look quite dashing in a captain’s uniform. Don’t you think so, Captain?”  Armin’s voice was a low, sultry purr, glancing over his shoulder with hooded eyelids. A low growl sounded in response and the blond let out a squeal of delight as he was pulled back down into the bed with his lover.  “You look even better out of it. Take it off.” Levi grumbled in his ear and the cadet let out a teasing giggle, wriggling back against his commanding officer.  “Make me.” He challenged and the older raised a slim eyebrow at the tone. “Take it off for me, sir~?”  Levi chuckled quietly and turned them so Armin was flat on his back on the mattress with the older man hovering over them. “You’re quite the brat, aren’t you?”  “I am. But you love me for it anyway.” Armin purred sweetly, batting his fairy-like eyelashes and smiling his best smile for his lover.  “I do.” Levi leaned in to kiss Armin before making quick work of removing the clothing from the blond for the second time that night. *~*TEXT*~*

I knew at three, but I didn’t want to tell her.  Waiting didn’t matter.  She still thinks it’s a fluke. A big joke.  That’s my fault.  I bow in apology, “Please date me.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*这个时间点教学楼基本已经空了，只有操场还有篮球场还有人，时不时隔着挺远传来些声响。     叶修正坐在椅子上，下身不着寸缕，被逼迫着把双腿以极大幅度张开，穴口是肉红色的，还在非常明显的一张一缩，王杰希命令他自己把里边的跳蛋给取出来，那小玩具现在还在以最高频率震动着。     本来跳蛋就被放的挺进去了，过了两节课它进的更深了些，跳动的时候恰好抵着深处的敏感点，阴茎因为这种刺激而立了起来，头上还残留着白色浊液。     王杰希凑近用食指轻轻划过他性器端口，一笑：“之前自慰过了吧？”     他用的词过于露骨，导致温度从耳垂开始滚烫起来，叶修不敢撒谎，只好点头承认。     “你说你骚不骚？在厕所都能发情？”王杰希附在他耳边说，“还有，动作最好快一点，如果有人过来——”     叶修深吸了一口气，伸出两根手指进到穴里，隔着一段距离都能感受到跳蛋的震动，震的他有些腿软。     “是不是很不可思议？一个高中生，放学之后脱了裤子，坐着张开腿，自己把手伸到里边去，拿出来一个快要没电的跳蛋……”     叶修听着王杰希的声音和低笑，控制不住的又有些硬了，他喘息着用两指夹出跳蛋，下一秒目光投向自己的老师。     “怎么？”王杰希了然，却并不点破，逼他开口请求。     “请……请您进来……快……”     王杰希丢给他一瓶润滑剂，顺势坐到他面前的桌子上：“自己润滑，然后自慰给我看。”     什么？叶修怔了一下。      王杰希伸出一只手，挑起他的下巴，看到了叶修脸上淡淡的一层红晕，笑笑：“如果让我满意的话……就给你。”     他的语气和平时讲台上的那个老师截然不同。     叶修舔舔嘴唇，双腿的幅度又张了两分，提了提跨，穴口正对王杰希。     他一只手模仿性交动作撸动着阴茎，另一只手拧开润滑液倒了一些，慢慢悠悠探进后穴，胸口一起一伏，嘴唇微张着呻吟。     他的小模样实在太诱人了。王杰希觉得这不如说是在惩罚自己，顿时有些口干舌燥，解开皮带，一根已经微微涨大的性器随即露出来。     叶修立即凑上去舔了一圈，有节奏的一吞一吐，听到王杰希轻轻呼出一口气，感到口中被温热的一股黏稠液体填满，白色精液从嘴角一点点流下来。     王杰希揉揉他的头发，缓和了语气：“好了，站起来吧，你这样坐着屁股不疼？”     叶修吞下口中的东西，顺势站起来，转了个身，王杰希看到他的身后极为醒目的几条楞子肿起来，用食指摸了摸，语气还带着责怪：“你说你顶什么嘴？气我好玩儿吗？就找抽呢是吧，现在疼了？满意了？”     叶修还挺想道个歉的，但那三个字他实在说不出口，只好卖力肉偿了。     他上半身趴在桌上，用的仍旧是之前被打屁股的姿势，双腿略略分开，王杰希在他身后，阴茎下一秒就直挺挺的插了进去。     王杰希边抽插，顺带又用手抽了他臀部两下，低声问：“下次再和我顶嘴怎么办？”     叶修呻吟着，回答断断续续：“任……任凭……处置。”     “再有下次，我艹死你，听到没有？”     王杰希用力挺进去，极大幅度的抽插几下，边喘着气又问：“第三节课睡觉了没？”     睡得着才怪吧。     “没……”     王杰希满意的掰开他臀部的两瓣肉，进的更深：“以后再被我看到，你下辈子就带着跳蛋上课吧。”     “不……不敢了……”叶修服软。     “叫我。”     王杰希俯下身子，手从他宽大的校服里伸进去，揉捏他的乳尖。     叶修敏感的一颤身子，乖乖听话：“老师……啊……王老师……”     做爱的时候王杰希最喜欢听叶修喊他老师，因为这时他的语气总带着一种几乎是致命的诱惑，让王杰希恨不得狠狠艹他，贯穿他，搞得他叫着求饶，眼眶都要湿了，但前端还是兴奋的立起，白色浊液从顶端射出，小穴一张一合，像是求着他进来。     更不要提他身后的那两团肉还是红肿着的，太诱人了，无疑是一种盛情的邀约。     叶修的后穴又热又紧，成年以来只有王杰希进去过，他的后面于是很懂得怎样取悦对方的性器。     王杰希按着他的腰，将阴茎整根没入，反复抽插，透明的润滑液随着性器出洞还会拉出银白色的黏丝来，叶修边呻吟不止边撅起臀部去呼应他的动作。     “老师……啊……老师……”     王杰希轻轻拍了一下他的臀部，在他耳边说：“我发现每次只有在这个时候你才肯听话。”     叶修顺着他的指示直起身来转了个方向，王杰希把他的校服下摆拉起来让他叼着，露出腰部，手则伸进去继续揉掐他的乳尖，难以描述的快感直冲着天灵盖。     “第一次在教室里，紧张吗？”     “有……有点……”     “爽？”     “啊……爽……”叶修喘着气呻吟。     他自然而然的偏过头吻住王杰希的唇，用牙齿磨咬，舌头冲进对方的口腔。     “差不多了。”王杰希轻轻推开他，“回去还玩不玩？”     “当然。”     叶修眨眨眼睛，笑起来。     fin. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*With Buffy she could let go in a way she couldn’t with other people. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The nice thing about Buffy was that she was also a slayer and therefore had all the same powers Faith had. She was just a strong as Faith, if not stronger (she had been at it for longer, but on the other hand Faith was arguably more aggressive so maybe it was a toss up). With Buffy she could let go in a way that she couldn’t with other people. Well, maybe she  could  but the authorities might have ended up having to get involved later down the road if she tried, and she didn’t want that. She could leave bruises on Buffy and Buffy could bruise her. So yeah, being with Buffy was a lot of fun. But after it was all done and they laid there not talking, Faith sure as hell wasn’t going to let herself fall asleep. She knew for a fact that Buffy was only pretending to be unconscious anyway. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*    There are rather interesting things to ponder upon.       Myths, conspiracy theories, tales from long ago—  but, he believes the most interesting thing to dwell on is the way his skin feels underneath his palms.      Smooth, fair skin at his fingers, manipulating it anyway he wants to, making it flush. Leaving purple among the few freckles that litter his skin.      The way the man would cling onto him, fingernails raking down his back, leaving angry, red scratches in their wake.      He grasps his throat, thumb pressing against his pulse. Letting the vampire know that he is a living being, a being that he should feed from.      Blood will pool, the man before him gasping for breath. Clinging to him for a different reason entirely, raking his nails down his back for another reason entirely.      That does not occur.      Instead, his hand trails up to the man’s face, making him shiver; even then, he still leans into the vampire’s touch. Heaving a sigh.        “Perhaps, another time,”   the vampire’s brows furrow as he thinks, leaning down to steal a kiss from the man beneath him. Gray eyes open and staring, observing the way his expression would change.        “Yes. Perhaps.”      *~*TEXT*~*

I do it again.  Watery green orbs, pleading.  I want him, too.  He holds my hand; guides me there; it’s deeper than his mouth.  I don’t want anyone else to know this experienced, warm part of him.

Share breath. Something vital builds in Stiles’ chest. He shifts, dying to taste the ribbon of tendon behind Derek’s knee; the sleek hollow by his hip. Derek presses him down with one hand, but he holds him with his voice: “Stay.”   He slides down Stiles’ body like water and licks into him, gentling with fingers and tongue until the thing in Stiles’ chest cracks. “Now, Derek,” he snarls. Smiling, Derek obeys.    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*虚伪在生气。老白攀着他的小臂被顶得左右摇晃时便发现了。指腹下紧绷的肌肉宛若岩石坚硬，显示出了虚伪近些天卖力健身的结果。他顶撞得比瓦不管还要用力，老白简直怀疑自己的肚子要被这个男人干穿了，每一下都往他身体最深处钻。肉茎强行撑开紧窒的甬道，带着瓦不管几分钟前射进去的体液“噗嗤噗嗤”律动。老白勉强支撑起自己的腰把伸到面前的瓦不管的性器舔干净，上面浓浓的男性气息和酸甜的肠液让他羞耻得不愿睁眼。 甜瓜褪了裤子，半跪在一旁用自己的阴茎末端戳动老白空门大开的胸口。黏滑的液体沾落在被粗暴蹂躏后显出暗红色的乳尖，老白弓身想逃避，却被瓦不管按住后脑，口中的阴茎深入到了喉头。 “认真舔啊，白宝贝。” 老白泄愤般的捶了一下瓦不管的大腿，不轻不重，“啪”的一声在宿舍里却格外响亮。虚伪一下比一下重，很快老白就承受不住了，把瓦不管再度舔硬之后他吐出口中的器物，开口才发现自己的嗓音沙哑得厉害：“虚伪，轻点……” 虚伪抵着他的胯，每一次撞击都会带动沉重的两颗睾丸拍打在老白的大腿靠近臀部侧，“啪啪啪”声中把那里撞击得通红。虚伪俯身靠近老白，伞状茎端抵住后穴深处某点碾动，顿时致命的快感侵袭而上，老白低呼了一声掐紧了虚伪的手臂。 “别——” “谁肏得你更舒服？我还是瓦不管？” 老白根本说不出话来。虚伪似乎和他身体内部那最敏感的一点杠上了，变换着角度和力道对准了那里一阵猛干，老白被这弄得软了半边身子，泪水模糊了视野连虚伪的脸都看不清楚。他仿佛整个人长在了虚伪的阴茎上，他就是他的神祗，把他的喜怒哀乐把控于股掌之间，让他生他便生，让他死他也只能毫无怨言地跃入黄泉。莫名其妙的记忆片段在眼前走马灯般轮转，有一些老白甚至都没有印象了，然而所有这些画面的共同点都只有一个：里面有虚伪。 虚伪是转专业来的学生，大一那会儿这间宿舍只有老白瓦不管甜瓜三个人。新学期开学在宿舍楼下遇到虚伪时老白正在舔冰棍，和瓦不管开黄色玩笑开得起劲，偶尔瞥见艰难地把行李上楼的男孩便主动上去帮忙。可能那会儿不经意对上的眼神就埋下了不寻常感情的种子，直至今日全是老白的自作自受。 他在咬他的锁骨，细细的刺痛把老白的理智唤回了一些。虚伪的头发微微蹭着他的下巴，老白不自主地仰起头，把脆弱的脖颈送到了虚伪唇边。淡青色的血管俯卧于薄薄的皮肤之下，好似轻轻一咬就破，虚伪却不敢使劲咬伤他，刻下淡淡齿印之后还用舌尖爱抚般舔舐。这回虚伪射得比老白快，后者因为已经射过一次而仍然是半硬的状态。虚伪和瓦不管一样把精液统统浇灌在了肠道深处，老白也不想呵斥他们了，只觉被虚伪这么狠狠肏过以后自己的身体已经变得不像自己，磨得发烫的内壁尝过男人味道以后有些食髓知味，正在叫嚣着更多。 老白清楚接下来会发生什么，然而他没想到甜瓜不像虚伪和瓦不管，他比他们优柔得多，似乎事到如今反而没那么着急了。内射过的两个男人又开始一左一右逗弄他的胸乳，瓦不管按压着肋骨上缘的乳肉，似乎把他当成了女人。老白被这个想法震到了，试图推拒，却被抓住手腕桎梏住了。 “我不是女人！”老白瞪着瓦不管，他的心脏在震颤，他知道这一夜过去以后他们四个不可能回到以前的模样，然而最基本的，他不愿意成为他们的泄欲工具。 瓦不管看起来好像气笑了。他平滑的指甲碾着柔弱的乳头，把老白磨出“嗯嗯”的呻吟之后凑近他说：“我不喜欢女人，我只喜欢你。” 老白唇上被结结实实吻了一下，而另一边甜瓜抬高了他的下半身，将那被肏得又红又软的小穴敞开在了自己眼底。老白经历了两个男人，早就被干开了，圆圆的洞口甚至没法自行合拢，可怜兮兮地颤动着，流出了一小滩浓稠的精液。甜瓜自他骨肉分明的脚踝吻起，滑过微微绷紧的小腿，然后是终日不见阳光而格外细嫩的大腿内侧。他用两根手指把穴口往两边拉开，细心地清理起内里的体液来。老白感觉到指节抠挖的肿胀感，饥渴的穴肉正贴近甜瓜的手指，希望更大更粗的家伙安慰它们。 “清……清不完的。”老白强压羞耻催促道，“直接进来，甜瓜。” 甜瓜瞥了他一眼，动作仍是不停：“忍一忍啊，白哥哥，我在努力了。” 穴周在手指抠挖下变得又湿又软，清亮的肠液把大部分男精冲了出去，深红的穴肉一圈圈缩紧讨好着外人的手指，艳丽得一塌糊涂。老白催促不来甜瓜，又难耐身体内部的空虚，只好去含虚伪和瓦不管的肉茎。他把他们俩的性器拢到一起，嘴巴张到最开也无法同时含入，只好用舌尖舔吮两边的伞端，并且吸食从铃口分泌的体液。甜瓜看他逐渐变得淫靡，不知刺激到了他哪根神经，扶起自己的阴茎便冲进了大张的肉穴里。 甜瓜插进来的一瞬间，老白便射了。他颤抖个不停，神情好似登上了极乐而恍恍惚惚，无知觉半张的唇间呼出断断续续的气来，一声飨足的呻吟逸出，整个人便瘫软在了地上。新的阴茎和他经历过的两根都不一样，甜瓜的要更秀气一些，却有着过分巨大的末端，把后穴每一处都照顾到了。老白被干得一耸一耸，像个熟透了的果子，每干进去一下都会流出鲜美的汁液来。虚伪把他支撑起来，撩开汗湿的额发，细细密密地开始亲吻他的额头和眼睛。 “和我们一起堕落吧，老白。” - 那晚老白被三个人翻来覆去地操弄，和他最初做的那个梦一样，他们四个人从桌上做到桌下，又在床上干了一会儿，几乎整间宿舍都洒满了男性做爱的味道。到最后老白除了稀薄的精水什么也射不出来了，他们三个每个人至少在他身上射了三次，才把他抱进卫生间清理。后穴被玩弄得又红又肿，几乎看不出原先的模样，还是虚伪有先见之明在宿舍放了药，他们把老白体内的精液都掏出来以后才给他抹上药膏。老白精疲力尽换上睡衣躺在床上的时候感觉自己的下身可能有一段时间都不能用了，两条腿更是合不上，走路还得效仿罗圈腿病患者。 然后他想到了瓦不管那条天杀的内裤。总有一天他要把它找出来烧了。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The finger dragged slowly down his neck and the flat planes of his back, through the wisps of hair atop rippling muscle. Harry felt gooseflesh raise in its wake, and smiled into the pillow. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Harry was enjoying a leisurely morning in bed. It was warm— September First —and he wasn't ready to wake yet. A hand in his hair brought vague awareness to the sultry drawl of his boyfriend's voice beside him. "—because  today , the Hogwarts Express—" Harry felt a finger rest lightly behind his left ear. "—snakes its way from London, across the countryside—" The finger dragged slowly down his neck and the flat planes of his back, through the wisps of hair atop rippling muscle. Harry felt gooseflesh raise in its wake, and smiled into the pillow. "—onto the Scottish plains, into the highlands—" Draco's finger reached the small of Harry's back, pausing briefly before it snaked to the cleft of his arse. Harry sighed. "—before  slowly  sliding into Hogsmeade Station—" Harry shivered as a nonverbal lubrication charm slicked Draco's finger, and it glided easily between the firm mounds of flesh and gently breached his hole. "—where it will  unload  the finest young witches and wizards of tomorrow," Draco finished. "Enough talk about trains and stations," Harry hummed, sleepily shifting his weight. "You gonna fuck me or what?" He could feel Draco's smirk. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*十五岁的沈清秋，修炼尚未到家，不懂得装模作样，落到他手里时还要牙尖嘴利一番。他只会颤抖、呜咽，从喉咙里发出含糊的声音来。 大腿内侧抵着的东西硬邦邦热乎乎，沈九再怎么“不解风情”，此时也该回过味来了。他宁愿被秋剪罗扇几百个耳光，或者淋雨罚跪十个时辰，或者睡一个月狗窝，也不想被这么羞辱。 ——这个时候，沈九反而念起秋剪罗的好来。 转念一想，他又愈发地恨秋剪罗：要不是他把自己关在柴房里，自己也不会遭遇这种莫名其妙的唵囋事！ 只不过再怎么咒骂，沈九今天的结局也无法更改。 洛冰河按下沈九的腰身，摆出兽类交媾的模样。粘了涎液的手指滑进股缝，在臀肉上留下一道细细长长的水渍。从未开拓过的地方，连吞下手指尖都显得吃力。洛冰河指尖刚一刺入，沈九便惨叫起来，然而发不了声，只能尴尬地糊在喉咙口。他一想到要用那个地方，就控制不住地犯恶心，一时几乎要干呕。沈九甚至觉得这是个好主意，自己一身秽物，这人还能忍着臭味对自己下手？ 只可惜他饿了一天一夜，肚子早就瘪了，临时要他吐，还真吐不出什么东西。 不等沈九思考出脱身之计，他身后已入了两根手指，一丁点唾液起不了太大作用，洛冰河又抠又挖，甬道仅仅拓宽了些，依旧是干涩难行。沈九还没来得及适应这古怪的酸胀感，就被无情地捅了进去。 一时间，沈九脑子一片空白，仿佛有数百只蜜蜂绕着他“嗡嗡”打转，他什么也看不见、听不见。随之而来的便是剧痛，比平日里挨打还要痛千倍万倍——他想着，凌迟也不过如此了。不知哪儿来的力气，沈九一下挣脱了洛冰河的束缚，但手脚依旧发软，只能如毛虫一般，一下一下地向前蠕动，又丑又狼狈。 洛冰河轻易将他逮了回来，重新埋进他的身体。沈九这回是真真切切想要干呕了，莽撞的进入让他一时错觉自己将被肏穿。他后悔极了，自己先前怎么不偷偷带几个馒头进来，吃饱了便能叫他好看。初经人事的穴口根本经不起洛冰河这般操弄，更别提他本身就天赋异禀。脆弱的黏膜被粗长性器硬生生撑开，血丝一丝一丝地从褶皱里渗出来，一部分挂在紫红茎身之上，一部分被带出来，粘在股间，红白对比，愈发得触目惊心。 这是一场单方面的残酷刑罚。 洛冰河明明有天魔血，再不济，也能调动情欲、减少痛楚，可他偏偏不用，就这么肉贴着肉，枯燥地摩擦，将这种本该甜蜜的情事做得鲜血淋漓： 他就是要沈清秋一辈子记得他的第一次，死都忘不了。 都到这个时候了，沈九反而硬气了起来，一声不吭。洛冰河忙里偷闲，掰过他的脸一看，虎牙上挂着血渍，下唇都被咬烂了，只有实在控制不了的眼泪不住流淌。 他又笑了——连他自己也分不清这是嘲讽还是愉悦。 沈九是没有快感的，他甚至没有礼貌性地勃起，茎身软软垂着，可怜兮兮地蜷缩在胯间。洛冰河还在不知疲倦地肏弄，到了最后，沈九能做的只剩下祈祷，祈祷惩罚快点过去、噩梦快点醒来、这个畜生快点死。在昏过去之前，他仅能看见的是，眼前的草堆，和墙壁缝里透进来的亮亮的天。  沈九满头大汗地醒来。 他反复确认了好几次，才确定那惨痛的经历只是个噩梦。回想起梦里的一切，他忍不住摸了摸屁股，嫌恶地打个寒战。旋即，沈九又高兴起来，急切地跳下床梳洗：城里最近来了位仙人前辈，说要带他去修炼。他要打扮得清爽些，和少爷说两句好话，说不定少爷一高兴，就放他走了呢。 显然那时他并不知道，未来路上等着他的是什么。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Palpatine had said all the Jedi were traitors, including Obi-Wan. But Anakin hadn't really thought that the clones would succeed in killing his former master... *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*  Lord Vader stared down at the hologram, white-knuckled and aghast. Cody stood over— over Obi-Wan's  corpse,  Obi-Wan's lightsaber in his hand. “Best to be sure, Commander. He has cheated death before, you know,” Palpatine murmured, voice warm, safe, soothing. Except Anakin didn't feel warm and safe and soothed. He stared into a vacant, beautiful eye, saw the burn mark between its owner's shoulder blades. The familiar saber hummed to life, slashing across the neck of the corpse, completely disconnecting the head. Vader cringed, needing to shut everything,  everything  out and just curl up and hide for a minute,  give him a minute—  “You had to choose, Anakin,” Palpatine soothed, “and of course you chose your wife. Even he would have understood.” Except... Vader couldn't imagine a world in which Obi-Wan punched his saber through  Anakin's  back to save Satine. And his last words to Anakin had been of love and pride. So very proud of Anakin. Vader gagged... and then gagged again.     *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Bellatrix sighs, reveling in soft kisses along her jaw and gentle touches across her stomach, up her inner thighs. Light caresses ground her, soothe her. The scars of Azkaban and the Dark Lord fade under Hermione's loving attention. It's been so long since anything felt okay that Bellatrix barely recognizes the feeling. So long being what her family wanted, what she needed to be, until she no longer could tell what was her and what was them. Hermione brushes her lips against hers. "Don't think. Stay with me." Bellatrix does. She never feels more herself than when she's underneath Hermione. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*As soon as Kakashi’s name leaves her mouth, self-hatred washes over Rin. After making him go through this just when they also lost their friend not long ago, the last thing Kakashi needs is her saying his name like a plea, a faint last murmur.  There is gratefulness warming her insides, numbing the pain of his hand impaled through her chest. Blood rushes to her head, and if she tries hard enough Rin can pretend she doesn’t hear the crackle of Kakashi’s raiton over the ringing of her ears.  Here’s the thing: she doesn’t regret doing what she’s doing. It’s for the good of the people she loves, and perhaps there could be more ways out, but none of them are going to be of her own volition and Rin knows it.  At least this, here, the choice is hers to make.  Even if she’s breaking whatever little piece of him Obito’s death left intact.    I’m sorry, Kakashi .  She hopes he can forgive her. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“是这个动作吗？”  “配合一下啊，长城同志，你这样我很难和上司交代的。”  “你舍得让我被扣奖金吗？”  “腿再分开点。。。”     郭长城在上次被侵犯的同一个车厢同一根柱子上挂着，不同的是他身后的老变态换了一个。     “楚。。楚哥。。这样不太好吧。。。”郭长城在这个老变态的攻势下终于开口，从老变态的视角可以看到娇艳欲滴的一双耳朵还在抖动。  “？怎么不好？哦，你是说旁边这群人太碍事？我这就通知他们疏散，这里有办案需要。。”  “别别。。大家都还要上班的。。”通过这两个月的相处，郭长城知道楚哥做得出来这种事情，为了破案不顾规章制度什么的事情经常生。让他上司赵警官非常头疼。这是郭长城在等楚恕之下班一起坐地铁回家的经验之谈。  “可是我这也要办案子啊，万一有别的小朋友向你上次那样被欺负怎么办啊？还让我蹦出去帮他们吗？”     想到上次被楚恕之解救的场景，郭长城耳朵更红了。楚哥是他的，才不让楚哥去救别人!万一像上次一样救了人就去整天送人去上班，还慢慢送出了感情怎么办？？  毕竟，毕竟楚哥那时候就是这样送他的。  郭长城越想越气，好啊楚哥，你居然想送别人上班，想找别的小朋友了吗!楚哥。。是不想要自己了吗？  是啊，自己没什么优点，长得也不好看，性格还特别懦弱，也不会说话，身材就跟一块行走的小排骨似的，一点都不性感。和随时随地散发荷尔蒙的楚哥一点都不能比，楚哥长得特别好看，眼睛还特别撩人，每次一看自己，心脏就跟不上平常的节奏了。  难道要让楚哥去追求他的幸福吗。。。郭长城一阵胃疼。     “长城，没事吧？”楚恕之从后面看到郭长城蜷起了身体，不禁担心起来。停下了戏弄他的双手，一只手移到了郭长城的额前测他的体温，一只手安慰地放在他的肩上。     楚哥的手好温暖。  楚哥这么温柔，自己怎么连帮他破案都不愿意帮他。  不甘心，不想让楚哥去送别人上班。  暗自下定决心，郭长城做出了一个决定。     楚恕之感觉到一只手附上他的屁股，在往前按他。他的小兄弟开开心心地挤到了温热的臀缝中。  “楚哥。。”，郭长城咽了一口口水，轻声说，“是是是这样的。”  郭长城另一只手慢慢把放在自己额头上得手拽到了自己裆前，说着，屁股还特意往后撅了撅，十分温顺配合。     楚恕之身体一僵，在半空反手抓住了郭长城的手，从那个危险的位置移开了，然后抓着他直线向上到了自己嘴边，轻啄一口。  然后趁着郭长城分神的空当，一转身把他推到了车厢壁上，单手壁咚了他。     虽然郭长城站直了比楚恕之还高上那么几厘米，但是碍于气势加上郭长城蜷起来的大长腿，现在郭长城完全陷在楚恕之制造出的阴影中瑟瑟发抖，简直像哪家刚刚被劫的良家妇男。     “是你先惹火的，现在我真的忍不住了。”楚恕之嗓音嘶哑，低音炮在他耳边响起。     郭长城听了微微歪头表示疑惑。     然后下巴就被有力而附有薄茧的手钳住向上抬，看着突然放大的人脸，更加懵逼。     “唔。。”  好吧，现在他明白了。     楚恕之的舌头一遍一遍地舔着郭长城的牙齿，像是在请求他的允许。     然而郭长城好像在刚才就已经把自己的决心用完了，现在他憋的满脸通红，已然一副生无可恋我就不呼吸了憋死我算了的样子。     “好好呼吸。”楚恕之轻笑。  顺手捏了把郭长城手感上乘的屁股，趁着他惊呼，如愿以偿地把舌头钻入了郭长城的口中。挑起了啧啧水声回荡在车厢中。     谁都没有在意车厢内满员乘客的诡异目光，谁也都没在意乘客们期待的眼神。     不过在他们出站时，郭长城好像听到了些对话。  “蹲了半个月了，终于见证了他们亲亲!”“你才半个月，我都一个多月了，天天过来守着，安检的见了我都要多测几回才让我进站!”“别吵了，我偷拍了几张照片，回头发咱们群里啊。”“太太，牛逼还是你牛逼!”“走了走了，回家p图。”     出站之后，郭长城看到了他们自然而然拉到一起的手，再一次脸红了。     “呆鹅，我是刑警，你知道为什么我会去抓地铁上的流氓吗？”  郭长城疑惑地摇了摇头。他也是在和楚恕之熟悉了之后才知道这个事实，看楚恕之那么年轻，还以为他是一个跑腿的实习生之类的。为什么一个专破疑难杂案的主力刑警要来管这么一个小案子呢？  楚恕之噗嗤一声笑了出来，“你知道答案的，自己想想吧!”     之后，不管郭长城怎么问（床上的时候他都试过了，没用!郭长城气鼓鼓.jpg），楚恕之硬是没有透露过一个字。           在他俩结婚典礼前夜，郭长城小心翼翼地问楚恕之，“你是不是还有一个曾用名？”  楚恕之玩味地一挑眉，“对啊，怎么了？”  “你之前是不是不姓楚？”  “对。”  “你是不是用过。。江明洋这个名字？”  “想起来了？”     想起来了，郭长城记起收到那名少年给自己来信的欣喜，也记起了家里一场火灾夺走了双亲性命，也完全湮灭了远隔万里两名少年的唯一联系方式。     也许这就是上天冥冥之中注定的，在少年时期暗生情昧，青年时期互定终生，老年时期相互陪伴。     从此，楚恕之和郭长城happy ever after!     楚郭的故事永远不完结么么哒~   *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*又到了早高峰，地铁内像沙丁鱼罐头似的拥挤，温度不断攀升，尽管有空调也还是热的让人想裸奔。  一眼望去人挤人的一片，其中却有那么一个人，穿着不起眼，挎着一个斜挎包，浅灰色长裤搭配白色外套，在车厢内也带上了帽子和口罩。从上车开始就缩在车厢的角落里。  露在外面的脖子显示出他年龄不大，白皙的皮肤透出一片殷红，有一滴汗珠正若隐若现，慢慢滑过他的喉结，如果你仔细看看的话会发现这个人一直在轻微发抖。  不过在拥挤的车厢里，没有什么人会注意到这一点，显然手机的魅力更大，低头戳手机的人遍布车厢。 突然，白衣人打了个机灵，梗起僵硬的脖子，眼中充满绝望。  一双手如约而至，在他大腿上来回摩擦，渐渐向上，直至抓住他的臀部。  他惊呼一声，又想起什么似的把手捂在了罩着大半个脸的口罩上。 周围人似乎听到了什么，拔下粘在手机上的目光四处瞟了一眼，见没什么异常就继续刷起微博。 那双手一直在他臀部揉捏，时而掰开，时而挤压，时而轻轻晃动那软肉。色情的动作，车厢内攀升的温度，急促的呼吸，隐忍的娇吟。如果不是他还扒着杆子，肯定就化作一滩春水，在后面人脚边求饶了。 这场景肯定是刺激到了那双手的主人，其中一只手开始探向隐秘的入口处摩挲，小心试探，身子也从后面贴上来。下半身大胆地顶在前面人大腿处一路向上磨蹭着向上，直至到前人的两瓣夹缝中，发出满足的叹息。 这时，车到站了，下去了寥寥几个人，又有更多人上车。使得本就满员的车厢更加拥挤。 谁都没有注意到这个两个紧紧叠在一起的人，毕竟经常有这种挤到身体有接触，人们见怪不怪了。 在停车上下人的时候，扒着柱子的那个人貌似松了口气，好像是在庆幸这不被骚扰的几十秒，尽力无视他臀缝里夹着的不明凸起。  可是在车开动的瞬间，身后人的手突然绕到了他身前，开始轻轻抚摸他的胯下，并且模仿交欢的动作开始一下下向前撞击，前后夹击让他差点哭喊出声。  他拿斜挎包拼命往身后放，想要让身后人停止侵犯，但是那人伏在他耳边轻声说了一句“想不被发现就别乱动。”  挣扎停止了，他的羞耻心让他停止了自己的反抗，低下头，含着泪，呜咽着靠着柱子默默承受这一切。 “干嘛呢你!”一个男声在他头上响起，并且抓住了那只在他裆前不停撩拨的手。抬手一拧，他好像听到了清脆的骨头错位声。 接着，在围观群众惊讶地让开空间后，一个身材健壮的男人穿着黑色短袖，把那个叠在穿白色外套身上的男人摔到了地上。 那个被摔到地上的秃顶男人挣扎着想跑，又被一脚踹回地面，以狗啃泥的姿态。 “你因猥亵他人被捕了，这位女士，可以回去做个口供吗？”边说话边熟练地把地上的人铐上了手铐，顺便把他的警官证亮给了他。  白衣人本来深低着头，听到这话，微不可闻地嗯了一声。 周围的吃瓜群众爆出一阵掌声，为民警降服了一个地铁痴汉，阻止了他猥亵小姐姐而开心欢呼。 正好车到站了，这名警察押着痴汉往外走，回头给了白衣人一个眼神，于是他遍快走几步跟了上去。 在几分钟的沉默过后，白衣人终于忍不住了“我。。我是男的。”  “我知道。”  “那。。那你。。。”  “你想让车厢里的人都知道你是男的？”  白衣人不可置否的又沉默了。  是啊，一个男性在地铁上被另一个男性频频侵犯，是说不太出口。  过了一会，一声谢谢你轻轻的飘到了前人耳中，回应是稍一顿的脚步和稍翘起的嘴角。  一路无言到了警局。 一名短发女子冲着那个刚把犯人关到屋里的黑衣警官吼到，“老楚，你看你怎么这么粗心，不是让你把那件衣服给这小孩儿穿的吗？”  被点到名的警官看了看自己腰间系着的黑色外套，“忘了。”  “嘶!你怎么就给忘了呢，你看看这小孩儿裤子!你这个钢铁直男!”  白衣人转身扒着看了看自己的裤子，羞红了脸，自己浅色裤子上有好几处不明液体痕迹。  “没。。没事的。。我。。。”  话没说完便被那名女子一瞪眼吓得低头装起了鸵鸟。  接过了黑色外套，在短发女子的监视下乖乖系上了外套。   “姓名？”  “郭长城。”  “年龄？”  “二十四。”  “家庭住址？”  “龙城家园八栋三单元二十六楼一户。”  “工作单位？”  “特调处。”  “哟，同行，这是第一次吗？”  “不。。不是。。前几天坐地铁开始就。。就一直有。。。”  “嗤，那怎么没想着报案啊？”  被楚警官笑话，郭长城脸更红了，“我怕。。怕打扰警察叔叔工作，就想着。。忍几天就行了。。”  “行了，以后就我送你上下班了。”  郭长城一脸痴呆地盯着面前的警察，楚警官接着说“人民警察的职责就是保护人民。我是什么？”  “人民警察。”  “你是什么？”  “。。。人民。”  “所以，我的职责就是保护你，懂了吗？”  郭长城再一次羞红了脸，点了点头。 第二天，打开门，郭长城见到了一身制服还带着帽子的楚恕之。  “长城小朋友，警察叔叔来接你上班了。”         彩蛋：短发女子是祝红。   群众：？？？这算啥彩蛋？？？？   星吏：名场面啊~   祝红：妈的死给。   星吏，卒于群众的乱棍和祝红的尾巴攻击。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*       楚恕之在几天外勤后，终于在傍晚回了家。这次的任务难度系数并不大，否则也不会只派他一人前去，但是那个低阶的花妖极其难缠。砍掉藤蔓之后便会重生更粗的出来，影响市容不说，还特别有粘性。 让楚恕之这个暴脾气来干这种擦屁股似的活也着实是为难他了。  终于用一个燃烧符解决了最后几条缠绕在地下车库的藤蔓后，符咒都没收拾就开上车直奔回家，这对于龟毛的老楚来说可是开天辟地头一回。  他实在是又气又累，甚至想把赵云澜的脑袋拧下来摆在自己老家前当祭品。 等到家时，外面天色已经昏暗。楚恕之进了家门就往床上一倒，打算进入梦中幻想乡好生狂扁赵云澜小朋友一顿。躺在床上正想明天以什么理由不去上班呢，一声敲门声打断了楚恕之的白日梦。  突然灯被打开，床上一沉，一只手搭小心翼翼到了的楚恕之的胸膛上，“楚哥，你饿吗？饿的话我给你做碗面条吃。”  楚恕之心生疑惑，“长城？你怎么来了？”适应了头顶灯的亮度之后，楚恕之懒懒地睁开眼睛，见到了郭长城模糊的身影。刚想把他赶回家去休息，就看清了面前人的脸庞。 郭长城白皙清秀的脸上多了两嘬胡子。  看到了楚恕之的视线之后，郭长城脸一红，摸着脖子腼腆一笑，“嘿嘿嘿。。好看吗楚哥(´• ᵕ •`)”  见到楚恕之没有反应，就是一直盯着他的胡子看，郭长城有些慌了“楚楚楚哥你要是觉得不好看，我我等会就去剃了!!”  楚恕之之前的一腔怒火在见到郭长城之后就消了大半，看到他的胡子之后便把他的变态处长做的丧尽天良的畜生事完全忘到了脑后。 “呆鹅，我问你，你为什么要留胡子？”楚恕之轻挑一边的嘴角，以示他要开始调戏良家妇男小郭同志了。 “啊。。。我。。。我。。。我觉得。。。觉得楚哥的胡子。。。特别有男人味。。。”声音逐渐缩小，郭长城羞红的脸都快埋到裤裆里了。 “哦？是吗？你觉得我是因为有胡子才有男人味的？”楚恕之颇有兴趣的侧躺起来，用胳膊架起自己的脑袋（变态地）盯着郭长城的有趣反应。 “不不是的!楚哥本来就很有男人味!” “哪里有男人味？” “就。。就是，就是，就是。。” “就是什么？” “就是。。哪里都有男人味嘛。。。楚哥我去给你煮面条了”声音已经像蚊子嗡嗡一样的郭长城，下意识要逃下床。 楚恕之哪里会给他这个机会，伸手抓住郭长城的脚腕就把他捞回床上，抱在了怀里。 “先说说我哪里最有男人味。”   楚恕之脱了上衣，又把郭长城的脸贴到了自己棱角分明的腹肌上，“是这里吗？” 接着楚恕之又坏心眼地把郭长城摁到了自己裤裆里和自己的小兄弟打招呼，“还是说这里？”   千年尸王楚恕之虽然不是活人不用睡觉，但是公费出差，旅馆费多贵处里都可以报销。所以楚恕之每次出差都会订上离事发地最近的酒店，而且首选带星的。 然鹅尸王每天不需要睡觉，这定个房间单看也不是个事，所以，楚恕之每次回到酒店就开始洗澡，享受星级洗澡待遇。 这次任务碰巧是在一个五星宾馆附近，于是楚恕之这一天除了打怪，就是洗澡。   画面转回现在，郭长城还在回味那个火辣的吻，是和平常不一样的感觉。之前只有他楚哥的胡子磨他的下巴，现在他们两人的胡子蹭在一起的感觉非常奇妙。就像是小时候刚剃了寸头之后，用手摸上去似的奇妙。 然后在楚哥坚硬的腹肌上嗅到了他独特的味道，一点檀木的清香，加上薄荷的爽朗，闻起来是大地的感觉。 接下来，他闻到了更加浓厚的楚哥的味道，鼻尖上就是他的楚哥的小兄弟。 郭长城沉浸在楚恕之的味道中，无法自拔。   楚恕之见郭长城不动了，就有点慌。难道是他玩的过分了？想着赶紧把他的小宝贝捞起来呼噜呼噜毛呢。身下人突然亲了他的小兄弟一口。 楚恕之抓住郭长城领子向上的手突然僵住，嘴边溢出一句“郭长城，这是你自找的。”   楚恕之褪下自己的裤子，精神的肉棒就砸到了郭长城的脸上。 郭长城双手捧着总和他见面的好朋友开始用脸乱蹭，小胡子也时不时给楚恕之带来刺激。同时，楚恕之拿起润滑剂给郭长城耐心的做起扩张。 后来，郭长城见他的楚哥并没有什么动作，便开始搞事情。他悄悄地拿起润滑剂涂在自己的胡子上，开始全方位“照顾”自己手中的肉棒，一会蹭蹭茎身，一会滑过铃口。 引得楚恕之一阵阵颤栗，他佯装不满地夺过身下人手中的“玩具”塞到他的嘴里含着，自己继续扩张。 “行啊郭长城，你小子长行市了啊，玩的开心吗？今晚还长着呢，让你玩个够。”   之后他们干了个爽。   本来想这篇练习写肉的，然后写困了，所以。。。。请大家系好安全带_(:ᗤ」ㄥ)_     *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*【补档】 au ooc 深夜两点激情脑洞 一脚刹车，先给大家上保险笔芯 *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*楚正在怀着悲痛欲绝的笑容寻找着今天的食材“今天到底是哪只幸运的小竹鼠被吃掉呢？ლ(´ڡ`ლ)”  然后挑到了在一旁哆哆嗦嗦竹鼠郭。  楚揪起郭命运的后颈皮，“这只看起来太怂了，太怂的竹鼠容易被同类欺负，活不长的。”  竹鼠郭像是听懂了一般，开始拼命蹬着他四短的小短腿挣扎。  楚一把提溜起这只不听话的小家伙，双目对视，然后翘起一边嘴角说，“今天我们就来做烤全竹鼠好了”  到了河边，楚把小竹鼠放进河中提着尾巴开始仔细全身清洗小竹鼠。  既然是烤全鼠，那重点部位当然要重点清洗。楚就着提溜尾巴的动作把小竹鼠的身子一翻，摆成了卧趴的动作，开始清洗起它的小菊花。  不知是不是他的错觉，那只小竹鼠刚刚回头看了他一眼，然后娇羞地扒回了自己的前爪里。  它不怕呛到河水吗？  不对，这不是重点。  是自己太期待美味，出现了幻觉？  楚使劲眨了眨眼，向下一看，手中依旧抓着小竹鼠的尾巴，可是那尾巴变粗了些，而且那尾巴分明是从一个全身白净的少年身上长出来的。  不明少年就着跪趴在河中的位置，背部脊椎节节分明，薄薄的肌肉均匀的覆盖了一层，肩头透着暧昧的红晕，一头短发轻微的炸起，两只毛茸茸的耳朵向后微微耸动。  再向下看，刚刚重点清洗过的菊发娇嫩欲滴，还在不停收缩。更下面，是少年涨红挺立的欲望，随着身体的抖动颤起来。  少年感觉不到下身的异样感，便回头张望。  一时，楚见到了少年满眼的泪水，带着一丝不解，而更多的则像是渴望。  楚戳在河中央，手指保持着贴在前人菊花上的动作，少年僵在了刚刚的画面，一人一鼠都有些震惊，就是那种当天就能上uc首页的那种震惊。  小竹鼠郭战战兢兢地说:“楚。。楚哥。”  楚像是回过神来，“怎么，我喂你喂得不好吗？”  小竹鼠郭的脸立马蹿红，连忙否认，“不不不不不是，楚哥您。。。唔。。。。”  四唇相接，楚的舌头轻易地钻进竹鼠郭的口中挑逗，小竹鼠沉溺在楚的吻中，来不及下咽的口水挂在嘴边一丝，显得非常色情。  “今天没让我吃上饭，你要怎样补偿我？”楚有一点教训的语气在里面，郭的泪水立马溢了出来。  说话时，楚的双手也没闲着，一只揉捏着郭的毛茸茸大耳朵，一只撸着他的尾巴。  身体两个最敏感的部位被这样玩弄，竹鼠郭有些受不了，发出细微的咿咿啊啊的呻吟，掺着几声我错了、对不起一类的话。  楚翘起一边嘴角，说“知道错了，等会就老老实实补偿我，听懂没有？”  得到对方畏畏缩缩的肯定后，楚拿起了先前准备好在河边准备烤竹鼠的油，涂抹在手指上，准备开始开拓小竹鼠的甬道。拿了些早些时候调好的烧烤酱，用干净的烧烤刷刷在了小竹鼠的可爱丁丁上。 于是他们鸳鸯戏水，之后干了个爽。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Harry Potter doesn't expect any major revelation to come out of his therapy sessions. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“Harry, you’ve drifted off again.” Her spectacles slide half an inch down her nose. “It’s him, isn’t it?”  “Who?” Harry attempts aloofness.   “That Malfoy chap who supposedly doesn’t affect you.”  Blimey, she’s good.  Electra Davies, renowned magical therapist, makes those two hundred Galleons a session painfully worth it.  “He doesn’t— We just…  meet,  occasionally. We’ve done so ever since Hogwarts.”  Electra doesn’t challenge him. Instead, she asks:  “What is the content of your…  meetings?”  Harry blushes. A bluebird flies past the window. He focuses on it instead of her keen gaze.  “We… fuck.”  “Ah.” She steeples her fingers.  He’s overcome with a petty urge to shock her out of her calm professionalism.   “Yes, we  fuck,”  he repeats, vulgarly. “We barely talk, I want him so much. I slide my cock in him and I feel  alive.  Back at Hogwarts we used to fight, now we fuck. Happy?”  “Hogwarts.” Gently. “The place where you were happiest.”  Harry stills.  “What does that say about your feelings for him?”  Harry leans back in the armchair, stunned.   Malfoy.   Draco.   The unlikely key to his happiness.  His voice is small. “Feelings?”   Electra smiles. “I’m afraid so.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Death takes a walk among the lost.  Prompt: Return to Hogwarts *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Everything was cold, and his heartbeat erratic. His breath came out in a foggy puff that resembled cigarette smoke. Why here? Of all the places to come back to, why here, where so many horrible things happened?  Every memory worse than the last, each body nameless and faceless, and each expression either determined and terrified. He traipsed among the bodies like a grim reaper, his wand like a scythe in his hand.  Pale, cloaked in black, and collecting the souls of all who’d walked these hallowed halls, with his cold breath.  Reaching down, his fingers hesitated over the face of a girl he recognized as pureblood, but didn’t know personally. The girl was wrapped in a Gryffindor scarf, but her body was completely mutilated by claw marks, to the point that she was barely recognizable. But he saw her face, her wide unblinking, terrified eyes, and felt panic claw at his lungs.  “Draco? It’s okay. Just breathe...”  Harry pulled him into his strong safe arms, away from the nightmares and visions that being back at Hogwarts brought. They both knew this would be hard, he just hadn’t known exactly how hard. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"Oh Merlin. There…right there!" Harry cried out, trying to ignore the mop handle bouncing off the side of his head with each of Draco’s thrusts. “Quiet, Potter. Are you trying to alert everyone we're in here?” Harry moaned against his fist. "It wasn't my idea to be tossed into the broom cupboard for a shag, was it?" Draco slid his hand under Harry's shirt, tugging at the nipple ring there, the one Harry hadn’t shown to anyone else. Harry shivered, his arse clenching tight around Draco's cock. One more thrust and Harry was coming so hard his legs nearly buckled. Draco wasn’t far behind. A quick Cleaning Charm later, they pulled their clothes together and stepped out of the cupboard, into the hall. Draco gave Harry a quick kiss. "Let's go to dinner before we're missed." As he spoke, the Headmistress stepped from behind a tapestry. "A bit late for that, gentlemen. I'm fairly certain even the centaurs in the Forbidden Forest heard you." Harry blushed; Draco looked at his feet. McGonagall’s eyebrow went up. "Perhaps next year, Professors, you could have your annual  welcome back shag  in your own quarters?" *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Harry returns to Hogwarts—twenty-six years later. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*He returns in the night. No crowds, no children in crooked hoods, piled into boats. The teachers are asleep. There are only the ghosts, both real and imagined.  “Peeves,” Harry greets as he passes the suit of armour, a muffled groan of disappointment from inside.  Harry smiles and runs a hand along a wall, feels it thrum.  Twenty-six years… He blinks and can hear his friends laughing on the way to the pitch. Breathes in and smells the winter-warmth of treacle tart.  He takes the stairs to his quarters with restraint, though he longs to break into a run.  Inside, a fire dies in the hearth, the bedroom door left ajar. Thimbleful of cognac in a tumbler by the bed.  Draco stirs, hair colourless with moonlight, tousling on his pillow. Harry strips, discarding clothes on the way, nude when he arrives.  “Mmm… Headmaster.” Draco’s smile drowsy.  Harry slips under the covers, moves on top of him. Knees lifting, whispered charm... Harry sinks inside. A soft, broken mewl meets his measured thrusts.  Unrushed, gazing at each other in the dark, every touch of Draco’s hands says his name, says  Harry .   He’s home. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*早就听说那个斗有问题，再加上吴邪开棺必起尸的诅咒体质，不遇到点什么还真不正常，但是谁都没想到会碰到那种东西。 潘子和胖子被困在了通道口，吴邪和吴三省在两人的支援下顺利进入到了主墓室，墓室主人的信息寥寥无几，四壁和墓顶朴素无华，整个空间除了正中间的棺椁再无其他，与外间构造复杂的机关极不相称。 “大侄子小心点，越是这种地方越可能藏着更大的危险。” “知道，三叔。” 两人弓腿弯腰，全身戒备，随时准备应对危险，慢慢靠近棺椁。 接着棺椁被打开的出奇的顺利。 吴三省头上的冷汗落下，已经看到了最中间的棺材，他和吴邪对视一眼，小心翼翼打开。 一阵浊气喷出，两人迅速躲开几米，待浊气渐渐散去，再亦步亦趋走进，手电筒的光先到棺材里，几番试探，总算看到了整个棺材里，竟然空空如也，一个如此凶险的斗居然是空的，吴邪和吴三省眼神交汇，一瞬间都知道了对方心里怎么想的。 “有夹层” 吴三省迅速拿出工具，轻轻撬开，就是这一下，吴三省每每想起来，简直恨不得抽自己大耳刮子。 夹层里是战国时的物事，对他们这一次可以说是大丰收，就在两人戴上手套将手伸下去时，一条不知从哪钻出来的小蛇迅速缠上吴三省的脖子，没等吴邪行动，小蛇就消失的无影无踪，只有吴三省脖子上两个红点昭示着刚才的不是幻觉。 因为被蛇咬过，即使被医生告知没有任何问题，吴三省也再三表示没有哪里难受，吴邪还是坚持将吴三省留在了他的小古董店，并且为了照顾吴三省，他坚持要两人同睡一床，吴三省偷偷叫来潘子打算开溜，没想到吴邪留了个心眼，并对他三叔的申诉丝毫不为所动，冷面无情的镇压了吴三省的反抗，之后又装可怜控诉吴三省不懂他的心意，搞得吴三省再大的脾气也没了，只好乖乖让他照顾。 意外是在半夜时发生的。吴三省被突如其来的烧灼感弄醒，热度从小腹烧起，一直蔓延到全身，瞬间整个人好似在桑拿房蒸过一般，皮肤上起了一层薄薄的细汗，喉咙像被人掐住再拿围巾缠绕几转，连呼吸都很困难，最初的呼吸不畅过去后，吴三省打算挣开吴邪死缠着的手脚，去外面透透气，他小心翼翼拈起吴邪的胳膊，可没想到吴邪这几年练了下肌肉，一条胳膊箍住他不动的时候还没感觉，动起来才发觉简直就是钢铁手臂，吴三省只得作罢。偏生吴邪还不老实，被他扒拉了一下后下意识调整了一下姿势，不偏不倚，手恰巧放到了吴三省那不可言说的地方。 之前那股热劲被这一下子给彻底勾出来了。 吴三省只感觉口干舌燥，脑子也开始迷迷糊糊，甚至他自己的行动都开始不受大脑的控制。 “吴邪，吴邪。”他边叫边推吴邪的胳膊，试图把他叫醒。 他不知道他在干什么，他又清楚的知道他在干什么，就像身体里有另一个他指挥着他做事，但又不能被原本的他所理解。 吴邪睡眠原本很浅，可能是在吴三省的身边，嘴里说着照顾人家，结果把吴三省当成抱枕睡得香甜。他不堪其扰，送来了对吴三省的束缚，睡眼惺忪的对着吴三省。 得到解放的吴三省立刻半坐起来，接着，他做了两人都大吃一惊的动作。 他把手放在了吴邪的老二上面，隔着短裤衩意味深长的揉动起来。 吴邪的老二比新兵蛋子见到长官起立还要快，毕竟当吴三省勾着一双眼扫过他的脸，从眼睛的对视到在嘴唇的刻意停留，正常男人都知道那里面意味着什么，吴邪自然也是正常男人。 “尺寸不错，”吴三省对着他的老二还夸奖了一句。 吴邪霎时脸红到了脖子根，呼吸粗重起来，耳朵里都好像要喷出蒸汽，整个人又是兴奋，又是害羞。 吴邪现在紧张的全身紧绷，十指用力抓住身下的被单，他现在喘的吴三省都怀疑他要得哮喘，又表现出一脸大气都不敢出的样子。白天不是挺强势？说到底还是只小白兔，吴三省不禁有些好笑。 “你这尺寸大概能让我哭出来。” “三，三叔” “我现在渴了，”吴三省故意凑到吴邪的耳边，用气声说，“让我喝你的牛奶” “嗯……嗯……好，三叔，给……你牛奶，都给……你。” “好侄子”吴三省在他脸上啵一口，以示奖励，同时手伸进他的短裤，直接接触的感受让吴邪的老二跳了两下，变得更大了一点。 吴邪的老二现在和吴三省只有几厘米的距离，稍微往前一点就能碰到吴三省形状姣好的嘴唇，吴三省开始的焦躁感已经减轻了不少，他慢悠悠的向吴邪丢了一眼，再伸出可爱的舌头，他故意双手握住吴邪的老二，给吴邪要直接舔上去的信号，结果只是舔了一圈嘴唇，他的嘴唇原本就红润可人，现在在唾液的加持下更显得晶亮，和吴邪充血的性器放在一起，淫靡的意味更重。 吴三省慢条斯理的舔上，不放过柱身上的任何一个褶皱，像舔舐美味的冰淇淋，接着直接用嘴包裹，吴邪的性器太大，将吴三省的小嘴撑到了极限，咽不下的口水不断从嘴角留下来，打湿了床单，吴三省丝毫不为所动，他捧住吴邪的肉棒，上下嗦动，速度越来越快，吴邪的呼吸渐渐更加急促，没多久，一阵白浊射出，吴三省被呛得咳嗽。 “三叔，对不起，”吴邪愧疚不已，“我不是故意的，你别生气。” 吴三省丝毫没有生气，他看着吴邪腿上和被单上的白浊说，“真可惜，牛奶浪费了呢。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Picard winces as he shuffles up into a sitting position.  “You should find your bruising aesthetically pleasing, Jean-Luc.”  Picard bites into his toast, grunting noncomitally.  ”My cane is six millimetres in diameter; I spaced my strokes eleven millimetres apart to allow for the bruises spreading; and I repeated each stroke eight times in the exact same spot—”  Picard had been acutely aware of that repetition during last night’s beating.  ”—Which has resulted in five evenly-spaced horizontal lines across your buttocks.”  Picard hauls himself out of bed and over to the mirror to inspect the damage.  ”Er, thank you,” He chuckles. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The conversation Will and Hannibal had while driving to his hideaway before the Dragon came. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*”The dragon is going to kill us,” Will says as Hannibal drives them to his secret hideaway.  “No. He’s going to change us.”  “We’ll still dead, changed or not. “  “You don’t care about your life? You have a family.”  “Not anymore, thanks to you.”  “Save yourself.”  “I tried.”  “You need to be honest with yourself this final night of this life. How will you spend it?”  “With you. “  “I am glad it’s so, Will.“  “Yes. Don’t you wish I was Bedelia?”  “She’s not you,“ Hannibal says softly.  “She said you were in love with me.”  “She was being honest then.”  “Oh?”  “You know it’s true. You’ve always known, deep down that you feel the same. “  “Can the devil love?”  “Hades loved Persephone.”  “The Greek Underworld is not hell. At least, it’s not all hell, it has the Elysian Fields.”  “I would gladly go there with you.”  “You are insane.”  “What are you then, Will?”  “Lost.”  “I’m lost with you. We can be lost together.”  Will grabs his hand over the steering wheel.  “I’m lost without you,” he mutters almost to himself.  Hannibal smiles as if they aren't going to die at all. *~*TEXT*~*

Lips offer solace.  “Stiles, am I breathing? Feel my heartbeat. I’m alive? Right? This is real?” the wolf pleads.  Stiles splays his hand, warm against the Alpha’s racing pulse.  “Baby, you’re alive. You’re here. Safe. I love you.”  Derek shifts, putting his head on the brunette’s chest. “I dreamt I lost you, angel. Felt like I was dying.

*~*SUMMARY*~*perhaps he does desire -- perhaps you do, too *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Being so enthralled with a man whom you know possesses a centuries-old predilection for blood and could tear into your skin with his teeth if he so desired is troubling, to say the least.   In the middle of the night, tucked away in the most depraved, dangerous corners of your mind, you imagine what that might feel like: Wonwoo sinking his teeth into your neck, sharp incisors piercing into your veins. Would he be ravenous – pin you down, leave a bruise that wouldn’t go away? Or would he be gentle – hold you close, whisper reassuring words and sweet nothings into your ear?   You imagine how Wonwoo would touch you at all, feeding on your blood aside. How smooth his skin would feel on yours, how his hair would run through your fingers like silk. Him lying next to you, nothing but cotton sheets and a few inches separating the two of you.   How you would tell him you love him, and him saying it back.  That one hurts the most. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*两杯马提尼，或者仅是一次自欺欺人。  熟悉的声音靠近，他在身后亲昵地叫着我的名字，甚至已经迫不及待地用粗糙干燥的嘴唇去摩擦颈侧，湿热的呼吸间夹杂着酒精的味道喷洒在肌肤上激起一阵颤栗。敏感的要命，也许已经红了一片，我别开头闪躲着，倚靠在吧台边闷闷地笑起来，镭射灯璀璨的光斑划破黑暗，眼中影像开始缀满透明肥皂泡表面的彩虹，温热的掌心贴上后背。  第三杯。  他的指尖开出水晶玫瑰，带着细小尖刺的枝条刮破定做的西装外套，扎穿精心挑选的天鹅绒领结贴上耳廓，轻微的刺痛后温热的液体流进衬衣领口，我呆愣了一会，恍惚间意识到那是锈甜的血液便着急起身。  “我带你去……”  我们靠在一起，依旧是亲密无间的姿态，穿过拥挤的舞池，调音到面目全非的电子乐连地板都能震穿，独角兽端着杯白兰地在中央忘情扭动黑色长裙包裹着盈盈细腰与饱满胸脯，颈上莹润优雅的珍珠项链却被突然跳过来的袋鼠扯断崩了一地，那家伙惊慌地趴下像辛德瑞拉一样从满地的摇头丸里试图拣出那些小可爱，消失在一通乱踩的棕色马蹄间。  他的嘴里吐出金色彩带，配合着笑声喷向天花板，尖笑与欢呼在鼓膜上画出一只吉娃娃，活泼地踩着花瓶跌进棉花糖堆里吠叫了几声就被甜蜜淹没。我开怀地像个卖完柠檬水和烤饼干的五年级童子军，瞬间就被迎面飞来的雪球击倒在水床上，两只鹦鹉挥动着巨大的荧光翅膀煽起旋风，发出卡通片巫女特有的奸笑声。  “合上你的大腿，婊子！”粘腻粗壮的章鱼触手绞住我的双腿，它穿着铺满亮片的比基尼，应该是个女孩儿，这儿是拉斯维加斯，它们当然可以说人话，甚至说脏话。我近乎嘶吼着询问该怎么称呼他，在混乱间一只巨大的羚羊从躁动的怪胎堆里冲出，能够开膛破肚的尖利大角正在疯狂逼近。  “赫尔墨斯——！”他松开手，水床迸出海浪将晕眩的我卷进蔚蓝。  睫毛上的冻霜融化成冷水顺着面颊流下，沉重的眼皮如橡木门开启时发出老旧失修的嘎吱响声重新接收画面。破烂的红色纱帘搭在床边，五斗柜上的烛台是房间唯一的光源，床垫里的粗砺石子摩擦着裸露的后背，对，确实是一丝不挂的，下体的灼热鼓涨迫使我掀开被子起身，那绝对不是酒精，六条墨黑细瘦的蜘蛛腿实在地动了几下，腰间的肌肉完全能感受到它们的伸展，小腹隆起到不可思议的高度，昏暗的烛光下底端那些突起的青色又隐匿在新生的深色外壳下，稍显肥厚的触肢底端是锋利的毒牙，尖头小孔中喷出湿滑的液体像铺路用的沥青，灼热粘稠，几乎要流满整个房间。 我把双手小心地放在肚皮上盖住那块漂亮的红色的斑点，毫不慌张，仿佛生来就是如此般习以为常，更加意外地，我还知道我的孩子们正急于摆脱他们的妈咪，迫不及待地要从母体出逃，和兄弟姐妹一起钻进丝蛋里等着做个大人。屋外突然传来杂乱沉重的脚步声，酒瓶激昂的破碎声，我靠在墙边喘息着，敏感的生殖腔被卵子压迫着张开一条细缝，奇异浓烈的费洛蒙像瞬间爆裂的的香粉炸弹，渗进麦芽的醇厚里被有心人一口饮下。  “克里斯……”  潘神的羊角摩擦过滚烫发红的皮肤，敏感挺立的乳头，因为情欲更加湿润的艳丽嘴唇，我被紧按在他腰间，侵占狂野的雄性气味几乎充满整个鼻腔，仅仅是用触觉都能直观感受到的可观阴茎勃起着戳弄面颊，他是午后的沉欢，淫欲的使者，是解下镣铐的放纵。我难耐地扭动着笨重的下身，却不可抑制地吞进近在咫尺的阳具，柱身上暴起筋络在口腔中强有力地跳动着，来不及咽下的唾液混合着腥臊的前液将胸前弄得一塌糊涂。  “我的小水晶……”  生殖腔的的细缝被扒开，温热又坚硬的东西塞进湿滑的肉穴直接顶进深处，我的小坏蛋们更加兴奋了，推挤着彼此等待那层隐秘的屏障被突破。颇为用力的快速撞击激出惊叫，却被嘴里抽插的阴茎堵在喉咙间变成无措的呜咽，他是孩子们的父亲吗，我无法回头去验证熟悉的感觉，也或许是我已经变得人尽可夫，欲壑难填。  “好久不见……”  蟒蛇冰凉阴冷的身体缠住我，锋利的毒牙刺破肌肤，奶白色的液体从乳孔溢出被他分叉的舌头卷进长满毒牙的口腔里。金黄色的兽瞳像尖刀一样扎进我水雾弥漫的视野，蛇尾扬起，疼痛几乎要将小指整根切断，他得意地吐着鲜红的信子，游戏才刚刚开始。我颤抖着，发麻的半边手掌贴上了泄殖腔里探出头的阴茎，按着低温表皮下的骨头缓慢撸动起来，他终于又快活地嘶叫起来，毒液滴在我肩头烫出一瓣丁香。羊角恶魔也终于肯放过我的嘴巴，咸腥的精液被抽出的疲软阴茎带出口腔，暧昧地粘在嘴角，混乱淫艳。  “别怕。”  轻柔的亲吻印在那片凹凸不平的伤痕上，他放缓了操弄的速度和我更加贴近，强而有力的心跳如惊雷划破深夜，炸开腐烂肮脏的污泥。我喘息着摇头只把未被满足的下体推进求欢，他谁都不是，只是个可笑的，迷失的，企图在炼狱寻找一朵百合的，年轻又幼稚的神。  他射进了我的身体，那些调皮的小东西甚至来不及埋怨妈咪，蹦跳着从甬道中弹出，摔倒地板上碎成粉末融进毒液中，潘神回到了墙上的鎏金画框内，那条花斑蟒蛇吐着信子顺着窗户瞬间溜走，关门声响起，吊灯温柔的米黄色的取代了怪诞的鬼火，我揉揉眼睛，只记得刚才一瞬间闪过的金色。  “派对怎么样？”  唐尼递过一杯苏打水，我的天鹅绒领结好好地挂在领间，整洁优雅。 “像一场怪胎秀……”  我俯下身趴在他的腿间，小心地用牙齿扯开拉链，脑中的眩晕正在慢慢消退。  完美谢幕。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*To Josephine, there wasn’t a feeling in the world that could compare to the protective weight of Cassandra lying fully on top of her, bare shoulders and toned back within reach for her hands to explore.  “My love, how are you so soft and yet so solid?”  She laid her palm flat against Cassandra’s clavicle, fingers fanning out across a jagged scar.  “So valiant and so…vulnerable.”  “Now you are just saying words.” Cassandra frowned through her deep blush. She lifted herself up a little, which gave Josephine an excellent view of her breasts.  “Make me stop.”  And so Cassandra did. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Babe?”  Adam had pushed in too early for either Kyle or the girl he was with to stop. She had gasped softly, biting her lower lip at the sight of the man she was supposed to be dating, she had never been able to choose between the two men and when Adam looked jealous she had spoken softly, still not moving off Kyle’s lap.  “You could... join us?”  That had been all it had taken, Adam quick to cross to the girl, kissing her even as Kyle resumed his pace, the two men working her over just enough to make her come undone under them. Kyle swift to help her press over, onto, Adam, smirking when his friend groaned and arched to push deeper.   She might have not chosen, but they could make this work. *~*TEXT*~*

Jared grinned and put the phone on speaker. “Someone could have seen that!”  Jared leaned back on the couch, stroking his cock languidly. He tried to put as much suggestiveness into his voice as possible. “Well… When you left you said you wanted me to send you a pic later without the clothes.” He smirked and hoped Jensen could hear it. “Or would you prefer a video?”  Jensen sighed. “Damn it, Jared. Look to the left.”  Jared faltered and turned his head. A clothes horse stood on the balcony, laundry dry. *~*TEXT*~*

Years later, Beau was shocked to meet a woman who was the spitting image of the Rexxentrum Girl. That night, Beau wasn’t sure if she liked the taste of revenge or pussy more, but there wasn’t a difference when she was between the Rexxentrum Girl’s legs. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*30后续车部分  医生检查过得很快，爆豪恢复情况很好，大概是身体强健的原因，哪怕有些器官损伤，也都向着最好的方向发展。当然还是被医生要求注意休息，小心养病，他翻个白眼，绿谷倒是在旁边拿小本本记得很仔细。 一大波人乱哄哄地走掉后，绿谷在爆豪示意下凑过去吻他嘴唇，轻轻浅浅的，还是会羞涩，被爆豪摁住后脑勺稍微加深这个吻。轰在背后搂住绿谷的腰，将头埋在他颈后亲吻，亲昵而色情。 轰拿眼神问爆豪，做吗？爆豪回他一个废话的神情，咬着绿谷嘴唇，率先把手伸进他没系好的衬衫里。绿谷有点惊慌，他抓住爆豪手腕，问：“小胜，你现在身体没事吗，还在医院……”爆豪胸口还有点痛，毕竟折了肋骨，比起这个有些东西他更想现在就确认，所以他咬绿谷的耳朵，看到哪里咬哪里，疼得绿谷低声叫着，却又不敢太过挣扎，可怜兮兮地被病号欺负：“现在想干你，不想忍了。” 绿谷被他又咬又舔弄得喘息加重，爆豪太熟悉怎么撩拨他，可他也担忧爆豪的身体，咬咬牙挣扎着起来，满眼忧虑：“小胜，你不能活动太大，会影响愈合的！你得注意一些！” 爆豪就冲他笑，手臂伸到下方干脆地钻进他裤子里：“你替我注意就好了，反正你不是都记下来么？”绿谷被他强词夺理得一瞬间不知如何反驳，爆豪干脆越过他，望着后方的轰，虽然无论何时说这话还是带点不甘心：“三个人一起？” 轰点点头，回他一个笑容：“当然。” 他们折腾了挺久，绿谷怎么都不肯碰到爆豪胸膛，在爆豪差点发火的烦躁中最后决定是绿跪趴着帮爆豪口交，轰在他背后替他扩张。因为没带润滑剂或者安全套这种和医院、病人完全不搭的东西，轰只好用唾液做润滑。当绿谷感受到和手指不同的湿软触感袭击他后穴时，差点惊叫起来，过度刺激伴随着柔韧的快感令他不知所措：“轰君，别……呜……” 爆豪将他脑袋摁回自己阴茎上，抓着绿谷的头发提醒他专心点：“不就是用嘴帮你润滑吗，这么激动，下次等我把你舔射了。” 轰没理睬他们，专心将舌头伸进绿谷体内，感受他因为紧张而收缩的肠壁。绿谷总是害羞，身体就很成实，一旦被过分对待就会露出可爱的反应。他想了想，从绿谷后穴离开，安抚地吻了吻不安收缩的穴口，转身去桌上拿了两块形状不大的苹果碎块，在绿谷一无所知的情况下，代替自己手指，将它们缓缓塞进去。 绿谷被爆豪摁着头做口活，看不到轰对自己做了些什么，只能感受到又凉又硬的东西塞进肠内，还被不断向里推，塞进更多小方块来。他害怕得不行，舌头无力地贴在爆豪性器上，喉口的软肉被顶得酸疼。轰好心给他解释：“上午等爆豪醒来的时候随手削给你吃的苹果，既然上面的嘴来不及吃，我觉得用后面吃点也不错。” 他还温柔地伸手指进去搅动，带着棱角的硬块不断刺激绿谷肠壁敏感点，被苹果干得眼前发白的羞耻让绿谷更加难耐，他含糊地对轰抱怨：“轰君，不要这样，拿出来。” 轰拍拍他屁股，像是在安抚小孩子般柔声跟他说：“自己排出来，乖。” 绿谷难受得要哭出来，不只是轰，爆豪也看得到，要自己在轰和爆豪面前做出排泄这么羞耻的事情，他肩膀都不住颤抖。爆豪却揉揉他耳根，笑容里带点邪气：“废久，排出来，我想看。”绿谷抬眼去看爆豪，对男人添油加醋的行为报以愤怒的瞪视，轰还将他双腿拉得更开，用指尖点点刺激他的穴口，吻他后背：“绿谷，拜托，为我们做好不好？” 绿谷埋低头，将爆豪性器吞得更深的同时，缓缓收缩着，将体内的苹果块挤出来。哪怕没有正面看到，爆豪仍然被绿谷羞耻得浑身潮红，和用力的腰腹肌肉迷住。他望着轰，看到他被绿谷收缩穴口吐出果实的样子激得眼圈发红，最后一块几乎是被轰抠出来的，他解开裤子，性器已经硬得不行，分开绿谷被玩得扩张好的穴口，将自己又深又狠地捅进去。 绿谷没法专心给爆豪口交，他身后被轰摁着操干，一次次压过熟悉的敏感地方，完全是要拿过量快感逼疯他。而他无法张大嘴喘息，被爆豪顶着喉咙口操，窒息般的痛苦夹杂着更多快感，令他头昏。在轰彻底把他操射之前，他还算敬业地让爆豪射在他嘴里，浓稠的精液从嘴边溢出来，被爆豪用拇指蹭花了嘴角和下巴。 轰在最后时刻抽出来射在他背上，没有男人的手握住绿谷腰，他几乎要倒下去，瘫在爆豪身上。绿谷努力支撑着肩膀，脊背弯出漂亮的弧度，试图抬起脸看看他深爱着的两个男人：“小胜，轰君，你们开心吗？” 被他带着精液的漂亮笑容激惹到，轰和爆豪深吸口气，将绿谷再次夹在中间，都伸出手来和他交握在一起：“想让我们开心，还得继续努力。” 医生不来打扰，鸟儿都不凑过来鸣叫，时间仿佛都为他们静止。好让这三个终于放下心结的人好好亲热，共享从此以后的幸福时光。  END *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*全身也湿漉漉的小动物坐在浴缸里眨巴眨巴大眼睛。 堂本刚此刻浑身上下唯一的一件T恤，被蹩手蹩脚地脱到一半，露出少年柔软的腰线，一点点可爱的小肚子，暧昧的三角区，天然卷的体毛…… 光滑白净的肌肤在浴室的柔灯下显得更加惹眼。 堂本光一注意到堂本刚身上遗留着浅浅的小块伤痕。 是打架受伤吗？还是其他什么原因留下的呢？出于Dom的本能，他咬紧了齿肌。 抖S先生浑然不觉自己正在莫名地吃醋。 对这个湿答答地呆坐在浴缸里的小朋友完全没有抵抗力，赶紧把地面擦干之后，光一在浴缸前蹲了下来，修长的手指拨开堂本刚额前的湿发，堂本光一的眼里满是连他自己都没有意识到的温柔。 结果立刻换来对方一个大大的湿热的拥抱。 被突如其来地抱住，堂本刚身上的水把光一的睡衣打湿的彻彻底底。 彼此贴紧，两个人的心跳都变得暴露无遗。 室内的温度突然变得很高。 「要Koichi桑帮我洗。」 堂本刚白软的双臂勾着光一的脖子，整颗脑袋埋在光一的脖颈处，闷闷的声音热乎乎地打在光一的皮肤上。 从光一的角度可以看到对方红的发烫的耳尖。 堂本刚迷迷糊糊间感觉到自己的脸被光一轻轻地捧住。 「可以哦。」 那个人的声音低沉并且温柔。 堂本刚看到光一被打湿的衬衫，水渍勾勒出他形状优美的肌肉，还有若隐若现的人鱼线。 好近啊……近到都能看清对方镜片沾上的几滴水花，近到都能看清对方的唇瓣非常干燥。 我可能真的醉的有些过分了吧——大脑开始变得不听使唤。 堂本刚舔了舔嘴唇。 他硬了。 ……显然浴室里的两个人都发现了这一点。因为下一秒，他就被直接跨坐进浴缸的堂本光一抱进了怀里。 . 对于Dom而言，想要控制一个人身体的方式有很多。 可以借助捆绑或者拷锁，有时候，也可以通过单纯的语言刺激。 浴室的水汽缓缓升腾，明亮的镜子渐渐被蒙上白色的水雾。 宽敞的乳白色浴缸里，堂本刚被光一从背后抱在怀里。 比起自己此刻浑身赤裸的状态，身后人的睡衣睡裤都还好好的穿在身上，这种剧烈的反差带来的羞耻感让堂本刚不由缩了缩身子。 躲在光一怀里的身型显得更加娇小。 「Tsuyo想要我怎么帮你？」 低沉的声音紧贴着堂本刚的耳廓，几乎是一偏头就能咬住耳垂的距离。 堂本刚懵懵地，一侧过头就被光一深吻住。 乳白色的沐浴露被揉搓出泡沫，光一的手掌顺着怀里人细软的腰身一点点地抹上胸膛。 明显是刻意地触摸着敏感的位置，却故意不去碰对方肿胀的下方，堂本光一一点点地感受和欣赏着怀里人全部的颤抖和反应。 凌乱的呻吟已经无法抑制住，全身的力气都在对方点火一般的情色爱抚之下被抽离，只能喘着气，软绵绵地依靠在光一结实的胸膛之上。堂本刚难耐的小幅度扭动着身体，下意识地想要伸手握住自己火热的下身。 「不许自己碰那里。」 温柔但是不容拒绝的声音。 好过分…… 被欺负的人只能手足无措地瞪大眼睛。 「想要吗？」 爱抚戛然而止。 被突然放置的人委屈地想要主动献上亲吻，光一侧过头避开了，内心却被这个小坏蛋撒娇的举动可爱坏了。 「舒服吗？Tsuyo喜欢这样吗？Tsuyo想要我怎么做呢？」 「欸……？」 「不说话吗？」 圆滚滚的脚趾头因为害羞和渴望而收紧。 堂本刚觉得自己的下腹已经热的快要融化，全身的细胞都在叫嚣着，想要更多的爱抚，想要被对方亲吻。 想要来自他的更多的爱。 「不说话的话，我可不知道你想要什么哦。」 堂本光一使坏地抽身离开一段距离，背后突然消失的暖源让堂本刚瑟缩了一下肩膀。渴望释放的心情吞并了全部的羞耻感。在这里，他是安全的，世界仿佛只剩下他和光一，此时此刻他只急切地渴求着来自对方的一切触碰。 「想要……Koichi桑……摸我……」 背对着光一，红着脸说出这样的话，桃子一样形状可口的屁股轻微地扭动着，慢慢地蹭着光一的下腹。 「想射……」 堂本光一觉得自己理智的弦被轻易地扯断了。 ……规矩什么的以后再慢慢教他吧。 伸手握住对方滚烫的下体上下抚动，堂本光一铺天盖地的细密亲吻炽热的落在小刚的耳际，脖子，和肩窝。 指尖刺激着柱体敏感的顶端，那里立刻流出了透明黏滑的分泌液。 粉色的乳尖早已随着光一的动作变得立挺，稍微触碰到就会引来对方难以压抑的呻吟。 堂本刚的脑袋晕乎乎的，全世界逐渐变得只剩下光一。 他的亲吻和抚摸。 身体像热烈的波浪中的帆船，随着对方的动作感受着快感。 被支配的同时被爱着。 高潮来临的时候眼前一片迷蒙，释放过后，堂本刚瘫软进光一怀里。   下接lof *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*0# 我在要你身上去做，春天在樱桃树上做的事情。 ———聂鲁达 1# 诸葛青进入王也的身体时，产生了一种压倒性的快感。他的性器埋在潮湿温暖的甬道中，被穴内的软肉吸吮，挤压，在润滑剂的作用下，伴随着性器的抽插，不断发出扑哧扑哧的声响。 他伸出右手，握住王也有些疲软的性器，上下撸动。骨节分明的手指轻轻揉动龟头的位置，又将手下慢慢勃起的东西当作琴键，时轻时重地挑逗抚慰，感受性器在手中慢慢涨大的滋味。诸葛青拿出另一只空闲的手，在王也的乳尖停留，不停揉动。 他俯下身，在王也光滑的后背上落下一个又有一个的轻吻，欣赏着王也因为他的一举一动而情难自抑的生理反应。他喜欢看有着漂亮的肌肉的王也在他身下淫乱地颤抖不停的样子。 听见王也口中隐忍的细碎呻吟，诸葛青猛地大力抽插，指尖蘸上几滴性器交合处的液体，强迫王也张开嘴，将手指含在嘴中细细舔弄。 他凑近王也因为情动而发红的耳尖，说， “王老师，你下面出水了哦。” 2# 这不是诸葛青和王也第一次做爱。 将细长的香烟在指尖把玩，吐出的烟圈在空中出现又慢慢消失，诸葛青懒散地倚在床头，聆听浴室传来的哗哗水声。 他很享受和王也做爱的过程。180的身高，肌肉健美而结实，两条腿笔直修长，从正面进入时会紧紧缠住他的腰，在混杂着汗渍的暧昧灯光下不住摩擦。他的皮肤不白，在做爱的时候却会全身泛红，从脸颊到指尖再到胸前，淫靡而透着色情。王也的前列腺很浅，抽插时极容易碰到，每当前列腺被他的性器狠狠撞击的时候，王也总会浑身颤抖，连带前方的性器也颤巍巍地吐出淫液，直至高潮。 诸葛青回忆起在精液喷出的那一刹那，与王也交换的那一个湿答答的吻————在这之前的所有床伴，从来没有一个人能像王也这样，激起他所有潜藏的性欲与激情。 他起身，走到窗前的书桌，随手拿起桌上散乱摆放的稿纸。这是王也刚刚完成的作品。在电脑十分普及的现代依旧坚持使用手稿，圈叉符号修改着纸上刚毅端正的墨迹，在稿纸上勾勒出一幅幅最淫乱的画面。笔下的人物在无感情的纸上情动，勃起，陷入情欲的漩涡，亦如平日里无欲无求的王也方才在他的身下呻吟着达到高潮。 “这本已经写好了，你待会儿拿回去给老四吧。“王也从背后拿过他手中的烟，抽了一口，在耳边轻声说道。刚洗完澡的身体还带着潮湿的热气，混合着烟草的气息若有若无地挑逗诸葛青的神经。王也走到一边，抖了抖烟灰，靠在桌边，浴巾松垮地系在腰间，暖黄的灯光在腹肌上暧昧地打着转。 诸葛青凑近，将烟在烟灰缸中按灭，“这次是关于什么的？”他凑得很近，近到鼻腔里充斥着烟草的气息，下一秒就可以吻上王也的唇。 王也稍稍侧过头，想要避开诸葛青：“你刚没看？” “就看了一点点。”诸葛青不依不饶，笑着凑上前，轻啃王也的鼻梁。他一直觉得鼻梁是王也最性感的地方。高挺，端正，带着一股最原始的野性和自灵魂深处的蓬勃的性欲。 王也挑眉，拨了几下诸葛青散下来的发丝，随意道：“SM。” “SM啊......”诸葛青拉着王也的手放到自己下腹那个重新勃起的地方，“既然王老师正在研究这个，我们不妨以身试法，来试试？” 王也笑了一声，一只手捏住在诸葛青的下巴，与他唇齿相交，感受着舌头扫过口腔的快感，另一只手不断撸动诸葛青硕大的性器，让他在手中不断变大，高昂。在诸葛青即将喷发的那一刻，王也推开了诸葛青，笑着道， “诸葛青同学，你该回家了。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*This wasn’t Louis’ idea of a great Saturday, freezing cold in the middle of a field at the crack of dawn. His friend Niall thought it would be a great idea to help the local farm in the run up to the harvest festival. Niall, however was nowhere to seen and was not picking up his phone. I fucking hate you Niall Horan, Louis muttered as he hung up the phone. He pulled his fleece around him to keep warm. The induction email said their contact would be Harry Styles and he would assign them their tasks for the day. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*That knife meant everything to her. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*She got her first knife when she was twelve years old — an old family relic that never left her side, not even when she went to school, where weapons of any shape or form were strictly forbidden. She woke up every morning at first light, when the first rays of the sun hit her gleaming blade, only to be reflected directly into her then-closed eyelids. She spent the whole day the knife in her pocket or her hand, toying with it absent-mindedly as she read her novels. At night, she bathed with it by her side, and lay on her bed, cradling the precious object like a child. That knife meant everything to her, and she would take very good care of it. That was a promise. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Dracula feeds on a victim. Vampires are often portrayed as offering sexual temptation to their victims. But, perhaps, it is consensual... This scene presents the sensuality of the vampire in broad brushstrokes. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*He kissed her deeply. To her throat, his tongue lapped lasciviously; his mouth watering at the thought of soft flesh and the blood inside her veins. His fingers wandered. And she moaned into him as his red lips parted and his jaws closed to sink his sharp teeth into her. He made many similar small bites and beads of blood arose on her pale skin, which he lapped up sensually. She spread her legs to let him tease with his fingers; hers in his black hair. She arched to him as he fed; both were naked. Her bodily fluid dripping from his mouth, he captured hers hungrily. Sex was like a hurricane; it takes and then it shatters… * *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Warm lips parted, panting, as a tongue ran up and down his length...He moaned and arched, brown eyes squeezed shut so the one that kept fluctuating between natural and Ghoul color would not be seen. Hands roamed the contours of his body, then held him down by the arms as the tongue glided up his body to lick at one of his pink small nubs. He gasped, arching into it and yelping, when it was bitten.     He whimpered again, cheeks flushing as pretty eyes in a smirking face looked into his...The male above him swept his lips over the half-Ghoul's own, then positioned himself and pressed inside...The slightly smaller male yelped at the flash of pain, his partner distracting him with kisses until it became pleasurable...  -end of nsfw- *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*These are the people he should trust with his life. He doesn't. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Trust no one.  If Dipper has internalized any rule in the journal, it's the one that is the most simple yet complicated one.  It shouldn't have been so easy to lose all trust in his seemingly loving grunkle and his oh-so-sweet twin sister. These are the people he should trust with his life.  He doesn't.  He trusts no one.  Bill doesn't want his trust.  He even warns Dipper about trusting him. He's a demon. He's not to be trusted. He doesn't want his trust. He doesn't need his trust. All he wants is to wreak havoc. All he needs is a vessel to posess. A puppet to control. A small prize for all knowledge the boy could ever seek.  The flames burn hot and blue on Dipper's skin. The pain is cold and red when the demon enters his body, taking control.  He doesn't trust Bill. Even if he had trusted him before, he certainly wouldn't have done so anymore after their shared skin is ripped open, bleeding, causing them both pain as Bill experiments with his new body.  His eyes are sore and itching. His skin is ashen and cold.  But his mind possesses the knowledge of the universe. *~*TEXT*~*

Tony glances up from his coffee. “How’d you sleep?-” Stephen yawns - “Not well, if the dark circles are anything to go by.” “My dark circles are a permanent fixture of my face,” Stephen says. “Can I have that?” Tony hasn’t even gotten his first line of protest out before Stephen’s pulled his coffee cup away and drunk from it. And then spat it back into the cup. “Gross.” “What’s gross is how much sugar you put in there. What are you wearing?” Tony stands up and grins. “I was going to make you breakfast before I remembered you said i wasn’t allowed anywhere near the breakfast making machines after last time. But I got the apron made specially, so I thought I’d wear it anyway. You like?” “Is that.. you?” Stephen asks. “Tony-! Is that your-” “Mhm,” Tony says, staring over at Stephen. Who sighs. Glares.

*~*TEXT*~*In this tug of war you'll always win， Even when I’m right.   （九）  从那天晚上之后两个人仿佛有了一种“床上”的默契，尽管赵启平对凌远在床上试图装老司机但是每次都被反过来结结实实操一顿的可爱表现很是欲罢不能，但对方似乎没有想和他进一步发展的打算。他从来不被允许在凌远的家里过夜，就算两个人有时候在医院宿舍干柴烈火，做的再狠再累凌远也要坚持回家。 凌远的家里从来都只有赵启平第一天来的时候的那一双拖鞋，没有双人份的洗漱用品牙刷毛巾，更不要说其他的了。 赵启平感觉自己像个电动按摩棒，可能还不如电动按摩棒。  “我目前没办法谈恋爱。”做爱过后的凌远有点昏昏欲睡，但他还是强撑着打起精神靠在床头，赵启平提出交往和同居已经好几次，都被他不声不响的遮掩过去了，但是这次对方大有较真的意思，他难免感觉有点心虚。 “你要给我一个机会。”赵启平背对着凌远把牛仔裤穿好，他说这话的时候语气还是平平淡淡，但是凌远的直觉告诉自己这次可能没那么容易糊弄了，“也是给你自己一个机会，凌远。” 赵启平认真和他说话的时候喜欢叫他全名凌远。其实现在很少有人叫他的全名了，大部分都是一声礼貌又疏离的“凌院长”，就算是一起长大的三牛和少白，也因为和林念初离婚的事情对他有些隔阂。 “……我说了我会好好照顾你的，我也知道你没有从上一段感情的阴影中走出来，但是你要相信我，哪怕只是一点点。” 凌远望着他，神情有点恍惚，一半是因为困的，一半是因为他在思考他的话。 赵启平以为他没听见自己说了什么，有点无奈的叹口气，走过去想给对方一个惯例的晚安吻，却被人一把抓住了手腕，他扬了扬眉毛带点询问意味的看过去，“怎么了？” “我们再做一次。” “我不想做你的电动按摩棒！” “我没有把你当我的电动按摩棒。” “那你把我当什么？！” 小赵医生涨红了脸几乎是吼出来这句话，而后他又有些后悔了，讷讷的道歉，“师哥，我不是故意凶你，我就是……” 凌远却没有给他更多解释的机会，他把他拉下来，仰起下巴以唇封缄了对方的声音，他的身体明明是很疲惫的，但就是隐约有个声音在叫嚣着还想要更多。 他觉得自己是疯了或者病了。  湿软的穴口再一次被撑开，深处还残留着没来得及清理的精液，这一次的进入毫无阻拦，赵启平将自己全部埋进去，满意的听见对方压抑的喘息声，肠壁讨好的收紧，像是不知满足的小嘴吞吐着将性器，凌远背对着他跪趴在床上，凸起的蝴蝶骨随着撞击的动作若隐若现，顺着往下到后腰和胯部，练成一道惊心动魄的漂亮曲线。 赵启平实在是爱死了这个姿势，他低下头在凌远的肩膀上啄吻，时不时的吮吸出几个牙印出来，每咬一口对方的小穴似乎就紧张的收缩一下，赵启平要被他逼疯，骂了一句骚货，狠狠掐住他的腰身狠狠顶撞起来。 按摩棒就按摩棒吧，牡丹花下死，做什么也风流。  “我、没有把你当成按摩棒……”凌远还在执着于刚刚的话题，话都说不完整，被体力极好的年轻人吃的死死的，呻吟声断断续续，带着泣音，“我不知道，啊……我当你是，轻、轻点……” “那你把我当什么，你说。”赵启平停在他最要命的那个地方，伸手握住了凌远几欲爆发的性器，对方发出一声不知是痛苦还是愉悦的呻吟。 快要爆发的铃口被人残忍的堵住，而体内的入侵者仍然恶劣的抵在腺点上不肯动弹，凌远被折磨的神志不清，有些崩溃的哭出声来，“我真的不知道，求你了……呜，放过我……” 赵启平被他淫荡的样子激的一阵邪火窜上小腹，只好放开了对方，加紧冲刺的速度，抽插了没十几下就射出来，而被欺负的不成样子的男人已经快要晕过去，性器更是像失禁一般溢出半透明的前液，汗湿了的碎发凌乱的贴在额头上，赵启平一边默念着色即是空空即是色，一边满怀内疚的退出来，他下床去浴室打了温水回来给凌远清理擦身，凌远也不知道是太累了还是睡着了，皱折眉头半眯着眼睛软绵绵的任人搓圆揉扁，小赵医生没忍住的吃了两把豆腐也没有遭到抗议。 直到最后赵启平收拾好一切准备离开，这时候已经后半夜了，他虽然也累的快要睁不开眼，但是知道自家师哥不留他过夜的“规矩”，只好认命的拿出手机准备叫出租车，却被对方在床上翻身的动静打断了手中的动作，他看过去，凌远像是已经睡了一觉又醒过来的样子。 “今天晚上就别走了，明天准你半天的假。”对方的声音还带着点沙哑，赵启平还以为自己听错了，他在原地呆愣的杵了一会儿，小心翼翼在床边坐下，伸手去摸人额头试探温度。 凌远啪的一声把他的手打下来，卷着被子又翻回去，半晌才生硬的丢过来几个字， “睡觉，不许说话。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The world is ending. The last bit of color is fading away. It’s too fast. It’s too fast.  “I’m leaving for good tonight,” the brunet says.  “I love you,” the redhead replies.  They are kissing, bodies pressed together, tongues dancing, and it’s warm, so so warm. The redhead shivers.  “I only love death.”  “I know.”  They breathe the scent of salt and skin and sadness.  “I don’t want to leave you. Come with me.”  “I can’t. Asshole.”  They are united completely for the last time.  “I hate you,” the redhead says.  “I know,” the brunet replies. And he becomes nothing. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The burning was what was right and proper. It took place out of bounds of heavily populated areas to protect the innocent from being caught in its cursed flame, but however not so far out that those who followed the blaze could smell the scorched metal and fiber. These nights were black and orange. Black smoke, blackened metal plating, and paper. All faded from black to back up into the dark sky back to the All Spark to redeem themselves a new unblackened spark. They stood, the once firefighters, around a writing pool of flame. They said it was to form a barrier between the sanctity of the council, and those that sought to destroy all they had achieved. After all, Inferno would not have been here, doing what was right and proper, if not for the function.      A sympathizer, thought long dead, awoke in the pyre, and screamed a wild and unhinged scream that sang a sickening song against the dancing flames.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*高阶关上门，快步走到沙发前，渡海依然保持着他们上次见面的姿势，用自己最舒服的角度靠在沙发上，一手揽着沙发背，一手拿着资料。头也不抬。  高阶站在沙发侧面，含着淡淡的笑意看着眼前这个假装没看见自己的男人，也不说话，就那么站着，盯着，像是观察猎物的花豹。  又是渡海先认输，他手一松，纸张纷纷落在地上，抬起头，略显无赖地拖长语调嚷道，“我硬了。”  他的爱人还是一言不发，只是走过来单膝跪在他面前，自然地伸过右手，探进了他的裤子，握住了他硬挺火热又敏感无比的性征。  一瞬间的巨大刺激让渡海无法压抑住本能，他颤抖着呻吟出声，靠在了高阶的身上。高阶圈住面前的男人，让他的额头靠在自己肩上，左手温柔地插进那头蓬乱的黑发，轻轻揉了又揉。  真舒服，渡海模模糊糊地感觉到，这个男人的肩膀又坚定又温柔，还有一股好闻的味道，他伸出舌头，舔了舔嘴边接触到的皮肤，一口咬了下去。  嘶，高阶吃痛地皱了皱眉头，没有制止渡海，反而撩起他的额发，怜惜地亲着他的额头。  逃不掉了吧…… 渡海朦朦胧胧地想着，索性伸手抱住了眼前的身体，他在自己没有察觉到情况下已经整个人贴在了高阶身体上，不停颤抖呜咽。  高阶的右手没有停过，他摩挲着，套弄着，时而轻轻揉捏，忽然又拨弄一下顶端，却总是在关键时刻停手。直到感觉怀里的身体似乎已经软成一摊水，他才索性扛起渡海，放在身旁的床上。  渡海躺下后稍微清醒了些，他刚想翻身逃跑却被高阶一把捞了回来衣衫不整地狠狠压在了床上。仿佛是对渡海的行为感到不满，高阶的动作开始粗暴起来，他直接把渡海的衣服推了上去，露出白皙中隐隐透出粉红的肌肤，低头一口咬在了乳尖上。  本来已经被高阶的右手撩拨到极限的身体根本受不了这样剧烈的感官刺激，渡海弓起腰，微张的嘴里流出带着颤音的轻哼，无意识地伸出手想去抚慰自己。  高阶没有松口，他继续温柔舔着那里，却伸出手去握住了渡海的手，转而引导着他握住了自己的性器，带着他用手服务自己。  大约是渡海的喉音太过诱人，也可能是渡海的手心太过贴合，没多久，高阶就大声呻吟着射了出来。  “渡海医生真是太棒了……” 高阶贴着渡海湿漉漉的鬓发，用颤抖的尾音把这句赞美送进了渡海的耳朵。  渡海并不是很高兴，他还没舒服呢。他无师自通地曲起一条腿环住高阶的腰，挺起身体主动去蹭对方，结果换来了高阶倒吸了一口气。他身体的不应期还没有过，心里被撩起的火简直无处安放。为了安抚焦躁的爱人，高阶医生一手扯下渡海的裤子，不顾对方意识到发生了什么之后的抗议，温柔地把他整个含进了嘴里。  随之而来的触感简直让渡海神魂颠倒，仿佛整个宇宙都在发出快感的尖叫，不等高阶来得及做其他动作，渡海就呜咽着释放在高阶嘴里，眼框湿润，眼角潮红。  “啊……抱歉……”渡海对自己的失控有些意外。  你……不等渡海发表些什么看法，他臀部就忽然有清凉的触感传来，高阶的手掌缓缓把粘稠膏体抹开，试探着往里插进一根手指。渡海发出表示不满的哼哼声，被高阶直接吻了回去。  在高阶半是温柔半是挑逗的安慰下，渡海的身体逐渐打开，整个人泛着一层美丽的粉红色，眼角的潮红叫高阶再也无法忍耐，抽出手指顶了进去。  渡海原本半闭着的眼睛瞬间睁开，然后又随着高阶的动作慢慢阖上，起初的不适过去之后，是充实的安全感和安心感，他又睁开眼，正对上高阶的眼神，那黑白分明的眼睛里除了自己就只有笑意和温柔。他顺着身体被带动的节奏抬起头，吻了吻高阶。从此以后，无论天堂还是地狱，他都会拉着这个人的手一起去，不是因为他无法忍受失去对方，而是因为对方会无法忍受失去自己。 *~*TEXT*~*

He pushed Tony’s hands out of the way and pulled down his boxers enough to grip his cock. “Yes?” he asked.    Tony nodded.

I can't hang out with them much without Hamilton being around, and I think Gil's noticed my look of utter dismay and disgust every time I see them with him.

*~*TEXT*~*喻文州又把眼睛闭上了。黄少天感到自己笑得不怀好意，贴上去吻上他，用牙齿咬住他的下唇轻轻向外拉扯，放在被子里的手也不老实，撩起一点睡衣下摆就往喻文州的背上滑去。 所以说人清醒了就会想要搞事——当然在黄少天看来他的想法堂堂正正敞敞亮亮，根本不能称之为“搞事”。只是今天早上喻文州给人的感觉总不太一样，仿佛在困意里露出格外不设防的柔软面，几乎让他无法克制。 喻文州似乎轻轻“嗯？”了一声，依然困倦的样子，侧躺着陷进枕头里，半睁开一只眼睛看他。 “不想睡了？” “睡不着啊。”黄少天委屈巴巴。 喻文州捉住他兴风作浪的手：“这样下去更睡不着了。” “等做完就困了，”黄少天撑起头来看他，眼里的委屈一扫而空，转而露出点狡黠来，“而且你不是说我想做什么你都陪着我吗？” 这话哪里是这么用的……喻文州简直哭笑不得，故意一样，不肯配合他手上的动作。 黄少天撇撇嘴，突然掀起被子伏下去，在喻文州作出反应以前，勾开睡裤和内裤，直接含住了他。   这也太刺激了。 舌尖软腻而湿滑，像这样突如其来地缠上来，喻文州脑中几乎瞬间炸开一片雪花屏。他几乎得定一定神才能正常地叫出黄少天的名字：“少天……” 然而他的语气还是带了点哑，黄少天对他那么熟悉，轻而易举地就听出来了。他根本没去管喻文州的话，尝试着又含得深了些。 毕竟是第一次做这种事，虽然黄少天有意识地收着嘴唇，但牙齿还是会从柱身上蹭过去。喻文州看着他毛茸茸的发顶，伸手轻轻摸着他的头发，在他再一次往深里尝试时说：“少天，可以了……” 闻言黄少天的动作顿了顿，犹豫了一下，还是吐出来，皱眉看着喻文州：“是不是把你弄疼了？” “没有，”喻文州伸手把他拉过来，“只是不想看你太辛苦。” “你这么一说还真是，”黄少天揉着腮帮嘟囔，“是我没做对还是本来就这样啊……这里好酸。” 喻文州只是笑，摸摸他的脸，带着他躺进自己怀里。 他们又回到了最开始的姿势，不过现在是黄少天背向着他。黄少天等了一会儿，发现丝毫没有响动，心里突然觉得不对，边说话边试图翻身：“我靠不会吧你还要睡——” “嘘。”喻文州的声音贴着他的耳朵响起，带着笑，仿佛一早等在那儿。 这也太……喻文州呼出的气息就打在他耳垂上，刻意压低了的气音，连带着他半张脸都恨不能烧起来。趁着黄少天被打断了说话的工夫，一只手从他的裤腰伸进去，在他的臀缝边漫不经心地揉弄。 黄少天的身体几乎立刻就绷了起来。他慢慢放松着自己，等脸上那阵热度消去，挺腰迎合起了喻文州的动作。 可是喻文州似乎并不想配合。他们在一起这么长时间，黄少天身上哪里敏感，喻文州早知道得一清二楚，却只是把他勾起来，然后吊在一个不上不下的状态。黄少天心里有些急躁，手也顺着自己滑下去，被喻文州一把捉住。 “别动。” 那要人命的气音又来了，语气里下了咒一般的诱哄。黄少天的动作真停住了，察觉到喻文州低下头，吻上他的脖颈。   接下来的事如同陷落在一场动荡的光影。黄少天依然背靠着侧躺在喻文州怀里，身上衣服早没了。喻文州的舌尖顺着他的脊柱一路滑下去，酥麻的快感之后是带有凉意的轨迹。他没有回头，完全不知道喻文州接下来会做什么，吻他哪里。那种撩拨，触感放大了无数倍，每一个毛孔都打开着，大脑兴奋到快要过载，还没怎么摸，前面已经直直杵着。 直到做好扩张，喻文州戴上套挤进去一个头部，黄少天才意识到他根本没打算换个姿势。 黄少天咬着牙等那阵酸胀过去，模模糊糊在想今天的扩张是不是不怎么够。性器一点点推开肠道的感觉，抽出去时又不断缠绕着牵扯，偏偏喻文州做得很慢，抽送的过程绵长到近乎羞耻。黄少天硬是克制着不让自己喘得太肆意，艰难地对喻文州说：“你别……” 喻文州用一记短促的深顶打断了他的话，肉体撞击的声音在清晨的房间中分外响亮，黄少天不受控地叫了出来，反应过来恨不能深深埋进枕头里当鸵鸟。 “你的耳朵红了。”喻文州凑上来，轻轻笑着说。 这他妈，喻文州这是要黑化啊？！黄少天甚至能想象出他刚才做那一系列动作时的样子，唇角带笑，游刃有余。 “你要不就快点……早做完早睡……” 喻文州又笑了：“少天不是睡不着吗？” 报复，原来是报复！黄少天索性扯过枕头盖住脸，把腹诽嘀嘀咕咕地全倒了出来。 “说什么呢。”喻文州把手探进枕头下，轻柔地摸了摸他的脸，“来，转过来。” 他现在的状态，又恢复成平日里那个喻文州了。黄少天顺从地翻身平躺，视野中熟悉的身躯和体温覆上来，然后他得到了一个久违的吻。 *~*TEXT*~*

James dug in, put pressure, and watched the suppressed shudder that ran through Tony’s frame. “Again?” he asked, his voice low and gravelly.  “Yes,” Tony said, turning his head so that his assent was clear. “More.”  He pulled back, raised the cane and then stroked down, once, twice, three times. Each time it fell, Tony groaned and rutted against the sheets. James leaned down, ran his tongue over the stripes, dropping the cane on the bed so he had both hands free to grip Tony’s hips hard. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*俩人第一次，黎簇好容易摸摸索索杆儿找对洞了，他这头急得满头大汗，乱动着腰就要往吴邪里头怼。  但是到底劲儿没用对，黎簇干动弹，下面那活儿不是因为润滑太多滑出来了，擦着吴邪臀缝儿了，要不就是刚塞进去个龟头，就觉得吴邪后边太紧了，他要精关失守。  无论哪种情况，都让黎簇又心急又焦躁。他这擦了把脑门的汗，扶着沾满润滑的兄弟准备再战，却发现吴邪的那东西不知道什么时候已经软了，此刻正没精打采的耷拉在了吴邪的小腹上。再看吴邪，更是皱着个眉头一言不发，丝毫看不出有"性"致，一脸淡漠的让黎簇怀疑现在吴老板接个电话，说话肯定四平八稳，不带一丝颤音。  这简直就是对男性来说，最大的耻辱啊。十分钟前他可是信誓旦旦在吴邪耳边说要操得吴邪叫他爸爸。现在别说是叫爸爸，估计吴邪都能背出一段朱自清的背影了。  不行，事关重大，今天必须得让吴邪见识见识自己的厉害。黎簇这么想，结果越急越错，越错越急，最后搞得他也软了，眼泪都出来了，抽抽个鼻子，趴吴邪身上了，喘着气。  "不做了？"吴邪问，"怎么还哭了？"吴邪搂着黎簇的脑袋，轻拍了拍。  黎簇不吱声，就埋在吴邪肩膀上抽气，感觉自己是受了天大的委屈，又或者是他没脸抬头看吴邪了。他这点小心思吴邪哪能不知道，又捋了捋黎簇的头发，吴邪轻笑了声。  然后他一手游移到了黎簇的腰背上，带着说不尽的温柔和欲望抚摸着黎簇，一边侧过头，软湿的舌尖舔舐逗弄着黎簇的耳廓。两处都是敏感点，黎簇感觉一个激灵，下身的性器又挺立起来了。  黎簇头还是像鸵鸟一样，埋在吴邪颈窝里，不抬起来，但是为了身下又硬起来的那处，他用手肘撑着，腰背带着屁股拱起来了一些。  黎簇又硬又烫的龟头顶戳着吴邪的后穴，可是有了心理阴影，这兄弟不肯前进了。这时吴邪也轻微幅度的撑起了身子，一手伸到下面摸了两下，握住了黎簇的勃起。  吴邪随意的撸了两下黎簇的那根，示意黎簇把头抬起来，他冲黎簇眨眨眼，弯翘的眼尾里都是撩拨，"小子，现在我教你...怎么操我。"话音落了，吴邪扶着黎簇的性器，一寸一寸的从龟头到茎身，最后都塞进了他屁股里。  "你先慢点动，找找感觉。呜..."被填满的感觉让吴邪一时有些脑皮发麻，他呻吟了一声，拽过 一个枕头垫在腰下就又躺下了。  黎簇小兄弟这会被吴邪后穴的湿软又紧致的肠肉吸得，早就感觉爽到了极点，没有能力思考了。他缓了会，憋住了射精的冲动，按着吴邪的腿根开始慢慢的插动。  "嗯....对，就这样。嘶——你先轻点！不怕等会又滑出来了。"吴邪担心黎簇要是这回在滑出来，估计就真有心理阴影了。吴邪弯起条腿，勾住了黎簇的腰。  这一勾不要紧，前面吴邪的话全起了反作用。黎簇的逆反心又上来了，你让我轻点我偏不，进都进来了，我得像样操两下。黎簇挺起上身，扶着吴邪勾住他的腿，还真是大开大合的操了起来。到了最后几下，黎簇更是用力，操得深了，也不知道具体是哪点了，他听见吴邪动情的喘了一声。  就在吴邪的这声喘息中，黎簇交代了子子孙孙，"吴邪，你叫床真好听。" *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Super short; almost not worth posting but, hey. Thanks for reading *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Castiel stretched out; spread finger tips slipping between waistband and tender torso. Grazing gingerly, drawing restrained gasps and soft squirms; raising and separating cloth from supple skin. Encouraging goosebumps with moist lips and delicate hands. Whispering “I love you”s in physical form. Dean always appreciated the way Castiel left these things unsaid. A secret language none would ever decipher; a privilege to encounter. These silent words were spoken in private, too intimate to  demonstrate to anyone else. Understood and unshared. Secret, private, cherished, important, required. Because they both knew Dean would never hear the words aloud; and could never repeat them back. Luckily, that never mattered much to either of them; what they had would always be enough. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“你站起来，这样像什么话？”boytoy严肃地盯着自己班上的学生王嘉尔。 王嘉尔瞥了他一眼，笑着放下搭在桌子上的腿，从boytoy的皮质转椅上起身，像没有骨头一样靠在办公桌上笑，“好的，老师。” Boytoy看他这个样子，无奈地叹口气，“你知道我叫你来办公室的目的吧？” 王嘉尔歪着头舔了舔嘴唇，“现在就要？可以哦~” 然后开始解校服衬衫的扣子，他的衬衫原本最上面的两颗扣子就没有系，转眼间就解了大半，黑色的胸衣完全暴露了出来。 Boytoy赶紧抓住他的手，阻止了他的动作，“停下！是你的裙子，你穿的这是什么？” “校服。”王嘉尔漫不经心地说。 “我们学校的校服裙子有这么短吗？学校明确禁止学生私自改校服，你不知道吗？” “它缩水了。”王嘉尔的谎撒起来毫无诚意，被boytoy握住的小手灵活地挣脱，反抓住boytoy的手腕，把他的双手拉到自己的胸前。 Boytoy被双手传来的那柔软的触感弄得晃了下神，反应过来的时候他就已经抓住那对即使还未发育成熟，大小也很可观的肉球揉捏了几下。 “嗯。。。老师。。。”小混蛋脸红红地半眯眼睛着看着boytoy，仔细一看眼里水光潋滟的。 Boytoy心中一惊，条件反射地把王嘉尔推了下去。 王嘉尔惊叫一声跌坐在地上，改短的裙子的效果就显现出来了，裙摆因为男孩的姿势上移露出一小截白色内裤，连同白生生的大腿根一起暴露在boytoy的眼里。 “好痛哦，老师。”王嘉尔委屈地不肯自己起来。 Boytoy站在原地和王嘉尔僵持了一会，弯下腰把他抱起来，让他坐在办公桌上，刚想推开，他的腰就被王嘉尔的两条匀称的腿勾住，双臂也环上来，属于他的独特香味一阵阵地扑在他脸上，这让boytoy迷糊了一下，连王嘉尔送上唇舌和他接吻的时候，都没想起来阻止。 然后把这个小妖精推倒在桌上做完全套也是顺理成章的了。 高中生刚刚发育成熟的性器又粉嫩又紧致，boytoy体会到了人生中最美妙的高潮，但当他把自己的精水射进王嘉尔痉挛着的子宫深处时，就开始懊恼起来。 王嘉尔仿佛读懂了他的心思，“没关系，我提前吃药了。” “下次不要这样了。”boytoy看了他半天，才憋出这么一句。 “每次你都这么说。”王嘉尔不以为然地抱住boytoy，高潮后他特别喜欢和boytoy贴在一起，他觉得自己好像有间歇性的皮肤饥渴症。 Boytoy一言不发地抱了他一会。 王嘉尔看着他，甜甜地笑着，“老师什么时候和老婆离婚？” Boytoy心下一惊，松开王嘉尔，莫名其妙地看着他，“我什么时候说过要和老婆离婚？” 王嘉尔委屈巴巴地憋着嘴，“老师不记得了？是第一次，你说我的身材很棒长得也漂亮，比自己家的老婆强多了。然后我说那干脆和你老婆离婚娶了我吧，你说好。” Boytoy回想了一下，第一次是自己和老婆吵架独自在外喝酒，喝醉后遇到了在酒吧和朋友玩的王嘉尔，然后自己就被对方带了回去。酒精的作用让他根本控制不住他的行为，就稀里糊涂地和王嘉尔做了那种事，同样也是酒精的作用，做完之后自己根本记不清当时的细节，难道自己真的说了那样的话？ 但就算说了，那也是在自己神志不清的情况下，何况自己当时还和老婆吵了架，还在气头上，所以才口不择言。而事实上自己和老婆没有多大矛盾，感情也不错，即使偶尔吵架事后也很快和好，王嘉尔只是个意外，虽然发生了很多次，但boytoy相信没有男人会拒绝那样漂亮的身体和脸蛋。如果说让他和老婆离婚去娶王嘉尔，那是绝对不可能的。 “我不会和老婆离婚，也不会娶你。”boytoy干巴巴地说着。 王嘉尔脸色一下子就沉了下来，“你说什么？” Boytoy是第一次听他这种语气，他平时的语气都是带着撒娇似的绵软。 “我说我不会。。。” “你说什么？”没等boytoy说完就被王嘉尔再次打断，声音也提高了一点。 “以后别提这种事了，也不要再做这种事了。”boytoy说完，低下头一言不发地用纸巾给王嘉尔清理。 刚把大腿上沾着的白液擦干净，boytoy把纸巾盒递给了王嘉尔，“里面的你自己来。” 王嘉尔没有去接，他的脸上再次浮现了一个微笑，搂着boytoy的脖子凑到他耳边甜甜地说，“老师，下个月之前请一定要和老婆离婚哦。” 然后推开boytoy，自己拖着发软的腿离开了办公室。  王嘉尔下午没有出现在教室。 Boytoy讲完课，在办公室批改了一会作业，就开车回了家。 妻子已经有了四个月的身孕，见他回来，接过他手里的包。 “终于回来了，我一个人在家好无聊哦。饭已经做好了，快洗手来吃。” Boytoy亲了老婆的脸颊，就去洗手，坐在餐桌前。 做的都是自己最爱吃的菜，boytoy一边听着老婆跟他讲最近的事情，一边吃着饭，偶尔夹几筷子到老婆碗里。 晚上，夫妻两人躺在床上。 虽然白天已经和王嘉尔做过，但只是一次，boytoy是个需求量旺盛的男人，而自己的老婆因为怀孕已经很久没让他碰了。 Boytoy试探着把手伸到老婆的腰上，被老婆推开。 “已经四个月了，可以适当做一点。”boytoy说。 “再等等吧，还是觉得有点危险。” Boytoy叹了口气，收回手，翻了个身合上眼睛。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“……药……药……”叶修蜷缩在床上，模糊不清地喊着，身下的床单已经被泅湿了一小块。  莫凡匆匆忙忙拿着药冲进叶修的寝室，一开门就看见发情的叶修两条修长的腿绞在一起不住地磨蹭。叶修那一双漂亮的手，一只正焦灼地抓着枕套，一只已经伸进了拉开的裤链里。  从莫凡的角度，他能看见叶修蹭开的衣襟下露出的一节细腰，白得晃人眼。  “药……唔……别看了……给我药……”叶修的手指摸索到了穴口，指尖忍不住探进去浅浅地抽插，努力给自己一些慰藉。  叶修看着莫凡杵在门口一动不动的身影着急了起来，再不吃抑制药他快撑不住了。  “快点给我！”叶修瞪大了眼睛，试图把自己的怒气传递过去。  可莫凡只看见叶修一双黑白分明的眼睛蓄满了泪水，还故意装出凶凶的样子，活像一只炸了毛的奶猫，过分可爱了些。  嗯，对，就是奶猫，还奶凶奶凶的。  莫凡兀自陷入想象，完全没注意到叶修颤颤巍巍地从床上爬了起来。  叶修走一步晃三步，步履蹒跚地往莫凡的方向踱，在距离莫凡一米的地方左脚一软，不受控制地往前扑了出去。  莫凡慌忙中接住摔过来的叶修，做的第一件事竟是悄悄地把抑制剂扔进了垃圾桶里。  “药呢？藏哪了？”叶修两只手在莫凡的身上摸来摸去，把上衣的口袋全部扫荡一遍后就去掏莫凡的裤袋。  现在是夏天，莫凡的队服裤里空荡荡的，他怕热连内裤都没有穿，叶修的手在裤袋里一摸索，指尖无法避免地就戳到了莫凡的阳具。  莫凡托着叶修腰的手一僵，刚刚就有些变硬的阳具现在彻底勃起了。  浓烈的Alpha气息从莫凡的每一个汗毛孔逸散了出来，凶猛地朝着叶修席卷而去。  叶修本就处于发情期，意志力几乎为零，被这样浓烈的信息素一刺激，呜咽一声身体就滑了下去，后穴里涌出了大股大股的肠液，一下子就把裤子淋透了。  后穴的空虚感比刚才更强烈了，叶修现在迫切地需要一根肉棒狠狠地贯穿他，然后把精液浇灌进他的生殖腔里。  手快脑子一步动作了起来，叶修毫不犹豫地拉扯起了莫凡的腰带。  越急越慢。  叶修忙活半天都没能把莫凡腰带解开，最后还是莫凡自己解开了裤子。  叶修的脸和莫凡的裆部贴的很近，裤子褪下的瞬间紫红色的一大根就弹了出来，直直地打到了叶修脸上。  莫凡倒吸了一口气，看着叶修被肉棒打到后吓懵的眼睛，下体肿胀感更加严重了。  脸上的疼痛让叶修的意识回拢了一些，他茫然地仰着头：“莫……莫凡？”  叶修顾不得水流如注的后穴，屁股蹭着地板就往后移，想拉开和莫凡的距离。  莫凡也不知道怎么想的，看着叶修退后的动作，心里邪火突然烧了起来，扣着叶修的后脑勺直接摁到了自己的胯下：“舔。”  咣当！  是门被猛的推开后和墙壁撞击的声音。  莫凡的手还扣着叶修的脑袋，僵硬着脖子回过头，和站在门前的逻辑面面相觑。  “我……叶修……我们……”莫凡的舌头跟打了结似的，一句完整的话都解释不出来。  罗辑一言不发地关上门，一步一步地走向了跪在地上的叶修。  莫凡惊恐地发现，罗辑的每一步前进都伴随着令人窒息的大量信息素外放。  同为Alpha，莫凡和罗辑的信息素是相互排斥的，莫凡甚至觉得罗辑的信息素有一点令他作呕。  反胃的感觉让莫凡身心都难受了起来，一般只有当一个Alpha比另一个Alpha的信息素更强势、更霸道时，才会让另一个Alpha感觉恶心。  这罗辑？居然比自己还A？  莫凡纳闷地要命。  “你……你信息素味道怎么这么重？”莫凡没忍住直接问了出来。  “可能是因为我很少释放信息素吧。”  “你连看电影自撸都没有过吗？”  “理工男，没时间看电影。”  “……哦。”  “唔……难……难受……你们……能不能行了。”瘫软在地上的叶修难耐地磨蹭着双腿，无意识地用下体摩擦地板，显然是已经完全陷进了情欲。  罗辑的脸开始爆红：“叶神你还好吧。”  叶修忍不住在心里翻了个白眼，当然不好。  还是莫凡上道，知道绕到叶修身后帮叶修脱下了裤子，两根手指戳进了叶修湿软的后穴里扣挖了起来。  “不够……呜……哈啊……还要……”叶修扭着臂想要被填得更满。  莫凡咽了口口水，二话不说抽出了手指，换上了早就硬的发疼的阴茎抵住了叶修的穴口。  嘴馋的穴口迫不及待地蠕动着吞吃起了莫凡的龟头，咬得莫凡连头皮都酥了，无意识地想把阴茎送得更深。  这一个无意识，一下子就把整根怒张的肉刃全捅进了叶修的身体里。  叶修没料到莫凡进入得这么快，惊恐地瞪大了眼睛：“莫——”  莫凡抬起头看了一眼，在叶修身前的罗辑竟然趁着叶修张开嘴的瞬间把阴茎塞了进去。  “好舒服啊！”罗辑感受着叶修温热的口腔发自内心地赞美着。  “嗯。”莫凡喘着粗气点了点头，“后穴也好舒服，紧紧的、湿湿的，像泡在温泉里一样。”  被前后贯穿的叶修受不住地挣扎了起来，想要说话嘴巴却被罗辑的阴茎堵着，只能发出呜呜的泣音。  莫凡以为叶修在嫌弃他们动作太慢，忙耸动着腰胡乱撞了起来。  罗辑见莫凡开始动作，立马有模有样地学着莫凡操持着阴茎在叶修的嘴里冲刺。  莫凡没什么经验，叶修的小穴水又多又会夹，他随便操两下就觉得精液要从龟头里喷出来了。好在莫凡年轻气盛，射了一次后几乎不需要中场休息就又兴奋了起来。  叶修能清晰地感受到莫凡在他体内射完精的巨物是怎样软下去又一点点硬起来的。  逻辑也没什么经验，所以只是口交就能让他满足得泪流满面，再加上叶修时不时抬起的通红眼睛，逻辑觉得自己就算现在立即去世去见阿基米德都心满意足了。  惨的是叶修。  叶修虽然被魏琛保护得严严实实，却并不是什么性爱小白。他是Omega，他有发情期，即是有抑制剂，性爱对他而言也不是绝对的避免，一些意外总是会发生的，比如现在这种情况，所以他可以坦然接受。  但是，做爱只要做到压制住他的发情就够了，并不需要把他当成一个容器一样永无止境地操干下去啊！  感受着上下两张小嘴一次比一次更猛烈地贯穿，叶修欲哭无泪。  就在这时，房间里又传来了咣当一声响。  被推开的房门和墙壁又一次猛烈地撞击在了一起。  紧接着是重物坠地的声音。  叶修含着逻辑的阳具勉强侧过脸庞，透过泪水模模糊糊看到的了砸在地上的食品袋，和站在食品袋旁边呆滞的魏琛。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Julian stares at you from beneath his lashes, biting his lip as he spreads his legs further. He moans, one hand working desperately at the thick, full cock between his legs. Your name leaves his lips in a wanton, whispered chant, over and over.  “Julian,” you murmur, and he   shudders .  “Please,” he whispers in return. You step forward, settling yourself between his legs and sliding your hand easily into his free one, disentangling fingers from where they are pressed into the sheets. You smile up at him mischievously before wrapping your lips around his cock.  A cry leaves Julian’s lips, unintelligible and   needy.    You swallow him down as he hits his peak, gripping his hand tightly. When you pull away, he makes a clumsy grab for you, and you let him pull you down on top of him, laughing quietly as you wrap your arms tightly around his spent form.  “I love you,” you murmur, and he buries his head in tight against your neck, another shudder running through him that you are well aware has nothing to do with the heat of passion.  “I love   you ,” Julian whispers raggedly, and you hold him just a little tighter in response. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*邰伟用身体从后面轻轻的蹭着邰林，手又不安分的绕过重要部位只轻轻摸邰林的大腿根，直到邰林的气息也不稳了，鼻子里哼出了两声气音。 “别......”邰林按住了邰伟的手，“明天还得去值班呢。” “恩......你这样也睡不着啊......”邰伟咬了咬邰林的耳垂，伸手把邰林宽大的居家裤拽到了膝盖处，又往前挺了挺身体。 敏感的耳廓被气息撩扰着，耳朵上的寒毛都像要竖立起来。隔着内裤薄薄的布料，邰林感觉到臀缝里嵌着邰伟下身灼热硬挺的东西，顿时红了脖子。 邰伟用脸蹭了邰林裸露在外的肩膀，说：“......我不进去。”他的手指从邰林的胯骨上向下滑动，点了点他腿根上的软肉。 “恩……”邰林哼了一声，声音也暗哑的不行。 听到邰林的声音，邰伟感觉自己更硬了。他爬起来让邰林背对着他趴着，先用手指隔着内裤温柔的摸邰林的前端，等到那儿滴出了水打湿了内裤，才不疾不徐的扒掉了邰林的内裤。“你湿了啊。”邰伟带着笑意说着，又脱掉自己下身唯一碍事儿的内裤。 邰林把脸埋在枕头里，红着耳朵，很快感觉到邰伟身体上的灼热重新贴在了他裸露的屁股上，上下的滑动着，最后滑到了大腿根儿上，接着从他紧闭的双腿之间硬塞了进去。 邰林的双腿是又长又直，肌肉又匀称又好看，并拢的时候腿根处一点缝隙也没有。邰伟的性器就塞在他腿根那一块儿软肉里，他的胸腔贴着他的后背。邰伟按住邰林的腰，摆动着腰前后抽插了起来，性器穿过紧紧闭合的双腿之间，皮肉温柔的包裹着他，让他战栗的快感流过脊椎送进大脑。 “邰林......”邰伟难耐的叫了邰林的名字。 灼热硬挺像烙铁似的快速摩擦过邰林的腿根，摩擦过邰林的会阴处，他感觉大腿中间热的仿佛要燃烧起来。“慢......唔......”邰林好容易说了句话，就感觉到性器被温热粗粝的手掌包裹住了，手掌的触感像干燥的像沙漠，打磨着他身上最敏感的地方。他的声音变了调，像丛林里看到猎人受了惊的野兽一样想躲开，可是又对手掌温柔触碰带来的快感抗拒不了。前面的温柔照顾和大腿之间不断的侵犯让他弓起了背，嘴里泄露出呻吟声。 邰伟的手从邰林的性器上拿开，捻了一下手指上黏糊糊的体液，又按住了邰林的背，把他的背轻轻按下去，让他的臀部自觉地高高的翘起来。 “夹紧点。”邰伟挨着邰林的耳朵上说了一句，用两根手指轻轻的掐了掐邰林的屁股。邰伟想着邰林全身的肉仿佛都长在屁股上了，其他的地方肉都很匀称，就屁股上的肉特别丰满。 邰林咬了嘴唇照邰伟说的话做了，羞耻心让他一言不发。接着他感觉到邰伟肿胀充血的阴茎又钻进了他的腿间，用力的前后抽插。邰伟的腰腹撞着邰林丰腴的臀部，阴茎向前撞的时候，撞的邰林的性器和囊袋也跟着颤抖，可怜巴巴的在身子底下颤抖着，流出的体液也被撞的滴滴答答的滴在床上。 邰林硬的难受，只能开口道：“邰伟......” “恩？” 邰林心一横，不顾羞耻的说：“......你再摸摸我......” 邰伟却有一搭没一搭的摸着邰林的胸肉，手指摸索着找到邰林的乳头，轻轻的捏住了揉弄起来，一会就把那一点肉玩的硬了起来。“摸这儿吗？” 邰林回了头，咬着嘴唇摇了摇头，汗水和体液让他浑身湿哒哒的，像刚从海里捞出来似的，脸红扑扑的，表情又委屈至极。邰伟这才觉着不忍心闹邰林了，他凑过去亲咬了他红润的嘴唇，把手移到了他身下，配合着自己在他大腿里抽插的节奏帮他摸了起来。 邰林呜咽的声音越来越高，邰伟觉得他快到了，就更加卖力的用手指取悦他，最后在邰林要射的时候，邰伟却轻轻按住了他。 “我们一起。”邰伟低低的在邰林耳边说了一句。 磅礴的快感被硬生生的截住，邰林的眼泪被逼了出来，他呜咽着点了点头，向后面沉屁股。这动作让邰伟很受刺激，无论生理还是心理上。邰伟又迅速的抽插了十几下，感觉血液都集中在了下身，又感觉邰林的腿间也越来越滑腻。 邰林这才感觉到在自己腿间进出的东西又涨粗了一圈，一直被禁锢的那地方也被放开了，他的眼前白茫茫一片，就像看到了冬日的天空一样，正在茫然的时候，有人紧紧握住了他的手。 他们互相依偎着在床上躺了一会儿，邰伟亲了亲邰林的肩膀，就爬起来帮他清理大腿间的东西。邰伟拉开邰林的大腿看了一眼，邰林白皙的大腿根上的软肉泛上了红色，满是肉体摩擦的痕迹，腿间沾满了邰伟留下的白色浓稠的体液，看着是一片狼藉，可怜兮兮的。邰伟赶快移开了眼睛，避免自己再次起反应，用赶快拿毛巾沾着温水帮邰林擦干净了。 邰林在他擦的时候轻哼了一声。 邰伟顿时紧张了起来，“破皮了吗？” 邰林也不回答他的问题，就小声说：“我困了，要睡了。” “恩，你睡吧。” 邰伟清理干净完邰林和他自己的身体，也重新躺回邰林身边，他知道邰林还没睡，就用了点撒娇的语气保证说：“下次我再克制点。” 半天邰林说了一句：“就知道欺负我。” 邰伟心里胡乱想着，你不也欺负了我这么些年吗？嘴上却忙不迭的答应了，这才老老实实的抱着邰林睡了。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Fed up with his abuse towards her, Natsuki shrinks her father down to be a fraction of an inch tall and kills him. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Natsuki was pissed off. She could not stand her father’s abuse any longer. So, instead of calling the police and reporting his actions, she shrunk him down until he was smaller than an ant and tortured him. She sat on her father before he could escape and started farting on him. She felt his legs breaking under her butt as she giggled.     Natsuki got off of him and ordered, “Lick my feet or else I’ll step on you,” as she wiggled her toes. Her father did as she ordered before she stepped on him anyway. She started grinding her foot on him, ignoring his screams for mercy. Finally, she took her foot off of him, noticing now his arms had broken off. “Wow, you’re even more pathetic than I thought,” she snickered.     She lifted him up to her maw and placed him inside. She began sucking on him as if he was a Jolly Rancher. A little while after that, she bit into his torso. She ignored his apologies and promises of never hurting her again and chewed him up. She swallowed his remains and smiled, knowing her father would never hurt her again. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Haru kneels beside her father’s shadow talking quietly as the Thieves keep an eye on their surroundings to give them privacy. “Thank you for everything, father,” Haru whispers before pulling out a thin dagger and stabbing Kunikazu‘s shadow in the heart. As Haru stands up, she doesn’t look back at his body; instead, she looks at her teammates.  “Let’s go, I’m done here.” They leave quickly without looking back.  Crow aka Black Mask enters the room shortly after the Phantom Thieves left only to find Okumura dead on the ground, he holsters his gun, chuckling.  Well, at least I don’t have to get my hands dirty. Well played.  He leaves as the ground begins to shake, signifying a collapse.  The day of the news conference and her father’s subsequent death, Haru acts horrified while smiling inside.  That will teach him not to force people to work as slaves, a carrot and stick approach works better after all  she bows her head, allowing the smile to show. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*A dumb Drabble about Lance being a dummy. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Keith and Lance sat on Keith’s bed. The atmosphere around them was tense and awkward. There was nothing to be done for this, of course. Who could possibly imagine a way to dissipate the tension from walking in on your leader with a wolf’s dick down his throat? Or even worse, being told that “I’ll explain when I’m done. I can’t just leave him like this,” in such a matter of fact voice that you could only nod dumbly and slide down the wall to watch from the floor like some pervert?        By now, Keith had explained the entire story, all the way back to his sex addiction at the Garrison. But Lance’s brain was choosing to ignore all of the psychiatric help his friend clearly needed in favor of one thought.  “So you...fuck Kosmo....regularly?”  “Yeah,” Keith said, still looking like it was the most natural thing in the world.  “But...isn’t he like...your fursona? So isn’t that like fucking yourself?”  Keith groaned and burried his face in his hands, “Lance, I swear every time I think I have a grasp on how much of a dumbass you are you throw something new at me...” *~*TEXT*~*

In fact she knew it, as her eyes dashed to the left  The master was grinning maliciously as if he already knew her thoughts, his eyes twinkling with unspoken cruelty and she wrapped an arm around herself on instinct. He would orphan them all if she left, if she fled he would kill their father and probably take her anyway when she was no doubt recaptured  What if she made it home, she thought of Bain and her little sister Tilda and steeled herself, she could endure this for them, for her family. Forcing a weak smile she met Bards eyes "no da, I won't run anymore" *~*TEXT*~*

He squeezes and Finn gasps, such a delectable sound as his hands fly up to Joe's bigger ones on reflex, he doesn't try to pry it away or struggle just rests them there weakly. Joe smirks his grip flexing against the pleasantly smooth skin, already marred red by his larger finger marks. He makes no move to stop and Finn try's not to move to much. This is a game they play after all, just a small fleeting thing between a demon king and the Samoan submission machine *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*        You’d been begging Hanzo for days to come at you with his best dirty pick-up line but every time he shot you down. Did he not have any? Or was he just too much of a gentleman to use one? You pondered this for a few days. You were pretty much ready to give up at this point so you stopped pestering him about it. This seemed to please him.          Days later while sitting on the couch with Hanzo he looked you over, his eyes stopping to look at your thighs for a fraction of a second before speaking up.          “You know..” he started, “Your thighs look good in those tights, but they’d look better around my ears.” Your face lit up in a second. Did he really just say that? Hanzo was pleased with your reaction. He’d been waiting to catch you off guard before complying to your wishes.          “Where’d that come from?” You asked, flustered.          “Hmm? Nowhere, just making an observation.” You sat there gaping at Hanzo and all he did was smirk at you. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*I'm terribly afraid this is going to anger a LOT of people, but I've been needing to say this for a while: I don't think Felicity can get pregnant any more. She was shot up so badly in the Season 4 mid-season finale that it severed her spinal cord. She was shot several times in the belly, in the area which houses the uterus and ovaries. I just think there's too much scar tissue in there now. Yes, we have the  magical "scientific" bio-stimulant chip which allows her to walk, but that is purely nerves, not muscle and organs.  I'm also sad/not sad about it, because it closes some storylines, but I think it can make the writers work harder too, and that's not a bad thing. If I need to add more tags or trigger warnings, please let me know and I will. If anyone wants to talk about it, I'd like to; I know this is a very sensitive subject. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Both were close to losing something important. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Bony wrists caught in an iron-like hold, Izaya couldn’t get away. Not today.   Seconds passed.   Warm breath tickled his skin. Izaya demanded that Shizu-chan let him go, but it sounded more like pleading. His words didn’t seem to reach him anyway.  It was starting to hurt.  Shizuo could see. But he didn’t care.  His face was free of all its usual ire. Perhaps better phrased was that his gaze was absent of emotion. There was only cold nothingness that Izaya was staring into.  It scared him.  But Shizuo was past caring.      He felt like a doll. Undressed and still.  Being played with. Being broken.  Shizuo appeared to be hiding behind his bangs.  He panted in the heat.  Both were close to losing something important.      He watched silently.   The pale, lanky wrist, now with a memory, was released.       Dollhood is entered in the wake of what's been lost.   With a stained cheek, the beast smiles. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*They stared down at the mangled, smoking wreckage that once was his beloved Aston Martin. “I’m sorry,” M whispered, her voice filled with remorse. “It’s all right. You’re still alive. That’s the important thing,” James replied. “It’s just a car.” “A beautiful car,” she pointed out. “It was.” He’d been incensed when Silva had blown it up. “It’s a shame though. I had hoped for the chance to fuck you on the bonnet when this was all done.” James turned to look at her, eyes wide with surprise. “Christ, M, I wish you’d said something earlier.” “So do I now.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The bedroom is always an incredible place. She’s talking to someone, someone important. Until this point they believe what she says about being hurt. You know the reality is different. She has a strong grip on your hair, and holy shit, that’s the most pleasant thing about this. You like pain and she gives it to you  and she takes care of you, too . This is magic. She mutes the phone. “I don’t think you’re doing it right.” You try to lick her better, because after all, you’re proud of being good for a reason. (She smiles and everything’s good.) *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*A hundred word drabble, implying josuhan. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Their lips connected, hands reached for each other in a desperate attempt to engrave this moment in their minds. No words were said. Speaking now would take away the magic of the whole experience. Both of them knew of the love that was always present in their encounters, but neither would admit to it being there. Not out loud, anyway.  They shed their clothing, letting it fall on the floor, an overly customized high school jacket and a green headband lay next to each other. Both men gave in to pleasure. Thinking about it would be useless, actions spoke louder. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Steve was breathing faster, like he had from the attacks that left him blue-lipped and panicked as a child, in another lifetime. He closed his eyes and felt the pull of suffocation, throat closing little by little. He liked the illusion of helplessness, being able to let go, too much.  He could taste Tony on his tongue. Taste betrayal and old dreams of people he'd failed. "Fuck," Steve choked out, feeling Tony pressing his shoulders down.   "Language..." Tony chuckled, mocking. His voice was low and rich as bourbon. "What would your fans say, huh Cap?"  Steve felt himself flushing. "Harder." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Small hands. Cold hands. Fingers stiff and pale, nails bitten down until that thin line of white is no more. Blood caked under them, around them, between them. Palms bruised and stuck with tiny splinters.   A face just as cold and stiff and covered in blood. Eyes open, unseeing and milky. Hair matted with blood that just keeps coming. An open wound, gaping and full of glass and metal. An open neck. Blood. Bone.   Warm hands trembling and shaking, holding a lifeless body. Silver hair shadows a face wet with tears. Screaming. Yelling. Crying. Cursing.   Somewhere there's a siren. Somewhere there's smoke and mangled metal. The black pavement is freezing. Snow burns red with blood.   Metal in and metal out. A body pinned to the ground, twisted and mutilated. And still warm hands hold it, cradle it.   Somewhere there's a goodbye, but the highway is too noisy for anyone to hear it.   Cold hands. Small hands.   Warm hands. Large hands.   They hold each other. Only one pair lives.   And then, they let go. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Thor, the queen of Asgard, and some other things seen from the point of view of the man called Bruce Banner. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Bruce has never went far and he has no desire regarding that. Penetration aside, he likes any type of sex just fine. And, well, Thor has never been fingered. He likes to please her. Not a priority, but whenever the opportunity arises (sex, mostly) he works on that. Role-playing wasn’t something he used to do often, just three times, if anything. He likes the role of a Doctor who’s examining his patient. (Sometimes, they rub themselves over each other, but that is not a talk for now.) The hint of green on his eyes goes away after this scene ends. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*4. 李振洋快要克制不住自己，几乎想把岳明辉拽过来摁在身下狠狠贯穿他——岳明辉这幅强忍情欲故作正经的样子对于同样禁欲几个月的李振洋来说实在太过诱人，像是一席饕餮盛宴摆在一个快饿死的人面前，浑身的每一个细胞都在蠢蠢欲动的叫嚣着要占有他。 想占有他，想贯穿他，想操他操的说不出话只能哭着喊自己老公，然后尖叫着被自己操射。 李振洋的眸色深了几分，冲着站在床尾的岳明辉勾了勾手指，声音也变成了染上欲望的低沉。 “过来。” 后穴的敏感点被跳蛋以相同的频率不知疲倦的震动着，毫无喘息机会的快感一波又一波顺着尾椎骨蔓延到四肢的神经末梢——从隔壁到这里还能支撑站立已是忍耐的极限，岳明辉尝试着迈开一小步，腿却酸软的好像泡在了醋里。 他踉跄了一下，要不是眼疾手快的扶住了床尾的帷柱，下一秒就是倒在地上的结局——而李振洋坐在床上笑吟吟的看着他，丝毫没有想帮他的意思。 这个禽兽。 岳明辉心里暗骂了一句，脸上却露出了惊慌的表情——而不知所措的讨好神色实在是大大取悦了李振洋，他好心的挪开了霸占了一整张床面的腿，拍了拍空出来的地方。 "爬过来，"李振洋发令道，"不准脱鞋。" 不脱鞋爬上床不把床弄脏的难度实在有点高，岳明辉站在原地想了半天，却被后穴中跳蛋顶弄地没了半分耐心，犹犹豫豫的绷着脚背就用膝盖磨蹭上了床。 李振洋靠在床头一动不动，什么反应都没有，岳明辉有点恼了，刚想抱怨他情趣玩过头了，却看到李振洋裤裆鼓鼓囊囊起了一个包。 装什么嘛，真的是。 他恶趣味的笑了笑，又跪着往前蹭了几步，俯下身隔着睡裤有些粗糙的布料，含住了性器的顶端。 "嘶——"李振洋被岳明辉的动作爽的倒吸了一口凉气，粗糙的布料在舌头的舔弄下来回摩擦着敏感的龟头，间接而强烈的快感让李振洋的性器在岳明辉嘴里又涨大了一圈，而岳明辉还故意抬起脑袋，从下往上的撩了他一眼，眼里夹杂着赤裸裸的勾引和万种风情。 这该死的小妖精。 李振洋五指插入岳明辉柔软的发间，发型师精心的设计被他弄的乱七八糟，却更有一种凌虐的快感，害怕把岳明辉扯疼了于是也没用上多大力气，虚虚的抓住发根警告似的扯了扯："好好舔。" "Yes,Sir." 岳明辉含糊不清的回答道，忍着后穴中隐约的瘙痒感，稍稍撑起了一点身子，咬着裤带熟练的一扯，就与李振洋的性器坦诚相见——显然是因为这几个月训练憋得不行，紫红色的柱身因为充血勃起，青筋毕露，显得格外狰狞。 岳明辉象征性的亲了亲性器的顶端，像是在和这个大家伙打招呼，手指调皮的在茎身上跳动着，又在会阴和囊袋两处游移不定，明明知道怎样能带给男人快感，却偏偏不肯轻易让他人得逞。 手指带来的快感似隔靴搔痒，怎可同湿热的口腔及后穴相提并论——李振洋有点急躁，但看着岳明辉嘴角戏谑的笑意又把那股劲按了回去，伸出两根手指挑起岳明辉的下巴故作轻蔑的说："怎么，你们酒店客房服务就这点水平啊，还五星级呢。" 岳明辉知道李振洋是想搞一些花里胡哨的东西了，也被角色扮演所带来的性奋感刺激到不行，于是配合的摆出一副被刁难得不知所措的样子，眼神是足以乱真的慌张："那，那您想要我做什么，我，我都可以……请不要投诉我……" "那你先让我舒服了吧。"李振洋大爷似的往床头一靠，"投不投诉你看你表现了。" 岳明辉本想演出一副被逼良为娼的不情愿样，奈何后穴中不停摩擦着敏感点的跳蛋实在让人无法专心，一波波似潮涌般的快感让他一个没忍住，就泄露了一声带着难耐的呻吟。 他看着明显在憋笑的李振洋暗暗懊悔自己的不争气，唾弃了自己这幅敏感又欲乱情迷的身子后索性自暴自弃的弯了弯眼角，笑意妩媚："包您满意。" 下一秒李振洋就知道了什么叫做天堂。 岳明辉湿热的口腔紧紧包裹着性器的柱身，狭窄的喉道吸啜着敏感的顶端，舌头灵活的扫过性器的每一处，舌苔上的粗糙像是在给每一处神经末梢传递一个叫做"快感"的电信号——他甚至还贴心的把之前口交时老是会打断双方的虎牙给收了起来。 岳明辉从前为李振洋口的次数屈指可数，时间紧不能做全套的话多半互撸出来就算草草了事了，更别说口的时候深喉了——也不知是角色扮演的性刺激还是怎地，岳明辉舔的很卖力，像是在吮吸一支吃不完的棒棒糖，全然不顾自己被呛的连连反胃，连眼角都泛起了生理性的泪花。 "好了，够了哥哥。" 见岳明辉难受李振洋就是再舒服也不想让他继续了，毕竟做爱是让两个人都要享受的过程，他又不是畜生，怎么可能让岳明辉难受然后自己一个人享受——他安抚性的伸出舌尖舔去岳明辉眼角的晶莹，然后在岳明辉因为被跳蛋来回折磨却迟迟达不到高潮而分外饥渴的小穴以至于把臀部翘的很高像是渴望别人来操它的臀肉上充满色情意义的揉捏着，时而又重重的掴了下，留下漂亮的红印。 岳明辉还没缓过来，一边喘气一边又笑："客人您……还算满意吗？" 李振洋没回答他，一边把他抱在怀里等着他缓过劲来，一边手指又隔着早已被源源不断分泌出的肠液给浸湿了布料在极度空虚的穴口打着圈，偶尔顶着两层黏答答的布料往里钻，惹的岳明辉一阵又一阵的战栗。 等到岳明辉耐不住了小声的催促了一句，李振洋才把他松开，手指蹭了蹭湿透了的后穴沾了些淫糜的液体，刚想开口让岳明辉含着呢，岳明辉就主动的伸舌把手指卷入了口中，舌尖细细的在指腹上画了几个圈。 李振洋伸手摩挲了一下岳明辉的脸庞，落下一个带着爱意的亲吻，随即又恶劣的笑了起来："上面的这张嘴我满意了，可下面的这张呢？" 岳明辉觉得李振洋就是个大混蛋，混蛋加三级的那种。 他居然让他把后穴里的跳蛋自己排出来，还威胁说买的是无绳跳蛋，如果他不能自己排出来就只能等那玩意儿没电了然后去医院取出来，那多丢人啊，是吧。 "就当是特殊服务吧，你们五星级酒店总得有些特殊服务吧，不然说不过去。" 高级定制的西装裤被扒下来胡乱的团成一团垫在腰下，擦的锃亮的皮鞋却还老老实实的穿在脚上，随着被摆成M型的腿在洁白的床单上形成了鲜明的对比，呼之欲出的色情气息，像是拍摄某种视频的摄影现场。 岳明辉在李振洋的诱引下不得不靠自己把体内那个磨人的小东西给弄出去，微微泛红的穴口一张一合的用力着，仔细看可以看见里面粉色的肠肉蠕动着。只可惜他经过长时间的达不到高潮的快感体力早已透支，怎么样也没法把跳蛋排出去，没有章法的一味收缩后穴反倒让它拼命地往里面钻。 岳明辉急得都快哭出来了，求救的目光不自觉的飘向李振洋，无辜又讨好的看着他，还没反应过来，下一秒，李振洋的性器便捅开穴口重重的顶了进来，连带着那颗拿不出去的跳蛋，狠狠的碾上了敏感点。 一瞬间带来的无以伦比的快感爽的他连脚趾头都性奋的蜷曲了，几乎是同时，他的脑中霎时一片空白。 岳明辉就这样射了出来，性器和跳蛋的双重刺激让他没有任何负隅抵抗的余地，在李振洋插入的那一瞬间，他便弃甲曳兵了。他看不清任何东西，只能胡乱的抓着身下的床单，像是要从虚无缥缈的快感中获取一丝真实感。 而身后的李振洋，没再给他调整的时间，一次又一次用力而富有技巧的抽插，让岳明辉再一次陷入在了情欲的泥沼里。 这的确是份完美的room service。 事后的李振洋如是说。 *~*TEXT*~*

Will, he says out loud and he comes all over his underwear and belly. He’s alone and sticky with his own juices and more in love than ever before. Will is nowhere to be found, but he will be. Hannibal is sure to get him back someday. He has marked Will most intimately after all, and made sure Will will never forget him. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Freedom, as many other words, can mean something different for different people. For Tony, it means being a submissive. Well. He can explain. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“Behave,” he never thought he’d enjoy being blindfolded again, but here he is. “or I will not allow you to cum.” A pathetic whine comes out of his mouth, and he tries to rub his legs against each other. A soft touch separates them again. It’s the cloak. “Oh, Tony,” Stephen touches his hair, caressing it, careful to not grip it hard. “didn’t you promised me you’d be good?” He cries. “I,” he’s  so  hard, he can’t tolerate this anymore. “ please , Master.” Stephen just sighs. “We’ll have to restart again.” He’ll be tired later. But this, right now, is freedom. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*水是冷的，呼拉拉拍在你脸上，把你从一夜暴富的梦里惊醒。     天哪，你想着。     这他妈什么玩意儿？！     横在床边的是一座巨大的水缸，喻先生笑眯眯地趴在缸沿歪着头看你，鱼尾巴一掀，蓝盈盈的水浇到你身上，把薄薄的睡裙浸到透明，紧紧地贴着，透了一点肉色。     噢——你说不上懊丧，甚至是有些愉快地舔舔自己尖利的犬齿。     首先你得知道，智人这个物种，在跨属甚至跨纲的交配史中，曾经肏过猪、狗、马、鱼、猫、羊、牛、鸡、鹿，根本不知道哪来的二皮脸去嘲笑泰迪，试图和所有己知和未知生物交尾才是你们的常态。     所以，看见下半身变成海豚的男朋友想交配是很正常的，不要怕。     你翻身把自己丢进水缸里，轻柔的衣服像鱼鳍似地飘起来，水流卷裹着皮肤，肢体是温暖而滑腻的，你抚摸过他的体表，亮晶晶的眼神互相对个正着。     哦，忘了说了，无论是智力水平还是交配谱系的宽广程度，海豚简直是水里的智人。     王八看绿豆，都是脑子长卵袋里的物种，谁比谁高贵呀。     你屏不住笑了，边笑边托着美人喻的脸亲吻，细软的发丝在你脸上勾划，尾鳍拧过来拍着你的小腿，实在是很优美雅致的生物了。     又优美，又色情。     海豚的皮肤又光滑又柔软，在水面下盈盈地泛着清淡的白，充满了弹性和力量，野性的感觉让人爱不释手，他略微俯视着你，笑的竟有几分可爱。     半浮在水里的脚纠缠着他光溜溜的尾鳍，手指漫不经心地来回抚摸着他的胸腹和尾巴连接的一小块皮肤，那感觉相似又不相似——毕竟优美的生物总是有共性的。     他握住你的手腕，双臂紧揽着你的腰，直奔主题地揉捏滚圆的臀部，他总是那么自持而优雅，这样热切到烫手的态度少见到珍稀，你给他弄的浑身发热，快活地眨巴眨巴眼睛，挺胸去挤⋯嗯？     突然就体会到了“给我上药时他两只手都搭在我肩膀上”的恐怖。     你睁圆了眼，又懵圈又惊悚，在喻先生恶劣的轻笑里机械地低头去看——肉粉色的阴茎从生殖孔里伸出，它太长了，都快有你的手臂那么长，柔软有力的顶部卷着你的手腕在你身上挨挨蹭蹭，请求着炫耀着，尾巴扇动着，在粼粼波光里一沉一浮。     多么美丽动人又情色下流的生物啊，你耳尖都红了——总有一些原始的低劣的疯狂的东西潜伏在基因里，它们探出头的时候，让你仿佛全身都浸在热潮里，向一切见到的生物渴求基因。     呵，智人。     你像是醉酒似的，醺醺然地反手握住海豚的阴茎，皮下蓬勃的肌肉和血脉敲着柔软的手心。你笑起来，有一点点促狭的亲昵，丰满的女性大腿根部有柔软的像云朵一样的皮肉，宽阔的盆骨给腿间留下充足的空裕，活泼的过分的性器被你埋在一片暖和的肉里，小小地挣扎着。     灵活的阴茎上端被你夹的紧紧的，在鲜嫩的皮肉间探索，对着并合的外阴肉缝反复勾弄，被渗出的体液鼓励了似的，试探着想拨开阴唇往里钻，你收拢了双膝——矜持的雌性并不想让孩子的父亲太得意，哪怕潮热红肿的黏膜和肉洞深处早已渴望到发疼。     美人喻不慌不忙，笑容可爱而温柔，像条真正的海豚似的用鼻尖顶你的耳廓——这种动物真是清纯脸乱交的典范，看起来几乎是无辜到可怜了，完全想不到水面下正摆着尾巴试图肏他看见的每一个洞。     还是不行，你遗憾地想着，海豚的阴茎上有厚重的肌肉，几乎像另一条手臂一样有力，孱弱的人类根本无力抗拒，还是被他挤入了潮热的阴道里，身体内部被触摸打开的感觉令人颤抖疯狂，你抓挠着他的脊背，急促地喘息着。     太深了太长了，甩着尾顶进来的性器甚至只没入了最上面的一小截，已经深入到你觉的自己被穿透了，过于灵活的顶端压迫玩弄着宫颈和穹隆，你觉的自己像块内里已经被搅碎的豆腐，又像溺水的可怜人，张开口呼看热气，不成字句地呻吟着。     他看着你，有一点儿温悯，又有极坏的轻诮与热切，这竟像是平日里雍容地窝在椅子里的猫样子了，他克制地甩着尾巴，湿润滑溜的皮肤和健康有力的肢体是对智人雌性最佳的视觉刺激，你着迷地看着，抚摸并亲吻这美丽的生物。     智慧生命之间，性是万能的沟通手段，你细细地抖着，透湿的布料在水面中一上一下地舒张又收拢，把自己串在美人鱼的画风很克苏鲁的生殖器上，被晃动的水波和有力的尾鳍一下顶到最深处，搅的像个内里烂透了的番茄，应激反应让疼痛的缝隙里都渗满了快活的多巴胺。     你想起了被海豚咬掉头插入腹腔的鱼，贴近死亡、贬斥与疯狂的性，兴奋到每一块骨骼都在搔痒。     美人喻微垂着眼，长尾顶着阴茎抽送，力道看起来对他来说已经很克制了，可你仍觉得刺激的过分，连思维都时断时续，像是被肏弄成了一滩水溶在他面前，周围都是略高于体温的热流包裹，体会到的是原始的无拘无束的仅剩下感官的⋯愉悦。     这太过了，你想着，被抛的太高了，也许普通的刺激很难再打动你了，就像尝试过迷幻药品的蠢货很难再通过甜食获得快乐一样。     海豚的射精力量非常强也非常快速，仿佛是水枪一样的力道，冲刷着里面，把内脏都染成他的味道，他的腹部都泛着粉红，最后的冲击又痛又愉快，混杂着怪异的失落，你无声地尖叫着，指甲深深陷进鱼尾柔韧的表皮里。     你愣愣地扶着他的肩膀，感觉到把你填满的东西退出去，糜软萎顿的肉洞红肿着挤出了一点他留下的东西，在水里飘着，像轻柔的柳絮。     噢，这真刺激。     你第一次体会到零几年台言女主干了仿佛长了百八十个腰子的总裁之后腰酸腿软的感觉。     “话说你今天怎么不说话？”     “我记得⋯人鱼公主不在水里的时候好像不能说话？”     哇坚持了人设的你很棒棒哦要不要给你张奖状？     行吧，你早就对喻先生火树银花的脑洞不抱希望了。     凑合过吧，还能离咋的。     你和老猫一样的喻文州在蠢作者的设定下变回日常躺回床上，越想越不甘心，一脚蹬在他腿上。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It hurts.  That’s half the point.  Saliva stings and mingles with his blood, smearing over his arm where the vampire licks and sucks greedily.  It isn’t beautiful, how they feed.  It’s like watching someone eat pork ribs or watermelon.  They are gentle, wary of losing a meal ticket.  He urges them on.  Not for pain; the thrill comes from below the skin, prickling from some place deep, behind his heart, where he marvels at the need, the dependency.  He isn’t addicted to a pleasure, but to their addiction to him.  He revels in feeding the fire that cannot be quenched. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*青帮这些年发展极快，盘根虬结，体系越发繁杂，做个临时工容易，但是要是想在帮内正式混个身份却是难上加难。偏偏那位兔儿爷栖身之地是个会员制，非青帮成员和会所会员不得入内，吴磊若想低调行事还是得搞到青帮成员这张通行证。  但是吴磊总是清醒的，事情按着他的计划一步步推进，像在拍摄一部按部就班的电影，他是演员同时也是导演，负责推动剧情也负责喊action，所以正如他预料般，青爷终于沉不住气找上了吴亦凡。  青爷上门那天他就躲在不远处的出租房内听着他们的对话，言语间他感受到了吴亦凡的挣扎与纠结，他想他似乎需要再添一把火。  红色的鲜血沾满吴磊的双手，他笑着轻轻一推，这位叱咤一时的黑帮老大的身影便骤然倒地。他的时代就此落幕。  ---------------------------------------------------     时间还很长，足够疗伤。  我深爱着我金丝笼中那只绒毛洁白的红眼睛兔子，它可爱又乖巧，我将沾满鲜血的匕首藏于身后，用宽大的身影掩盖身后那条垂死的毒蛇，我轻抚着小兔子的头，讲童话故事讲给他听，它没必要知道真相，它是我洁白又干净的小兔子。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Three more people survive the barricade. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*There are some days, Enjolras can't breathe. His ribs refuse to expand, his lungs pushing in vain against their bone prison, and he wishes the bullets had slipped through the cracks.  There are some days, Combeferre can't walk even with his cane. His leg is too twisted, too wrecked, and he wishes the canon had better aim.  There are some days, Jehan retreats completely into their own mind. The cave in their skull robs them of speech, of inhibition, and of movement on their one side. They scream in frustration and hobble in circles around the room, sometimes for hours on end. When it's over, they wish the bullet had been swifter.     There are some nights, Enjolras looks to the stars for answers, breathing in the crisp air as he wonders what went wrong.  There are some nights, Combeferre walks out to pull him into bed, fingertips only just brushing the wall for support, tracing up and down along the shoulders of friends long gone.  There are some nights, Jehan will roll over, tucked between them, and whisper "I love you" - just in case they are their last words.     Every day, every night, they cling to each other for comfort. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The whip cracks across the flagellant’s ass and the sound that escapes his throat is euphoric.  Rapturous .  The sting radiates in a way that he knows will  last .  But the flagellant is also determined to last. The bounty hunter had challenged him to a test of endurance after all.  And who knew how to endure better than him?  Another lash scores his skin, this one hard enough to make him strain against the ropes and hook that keep his arms anchored to the ceiling.  He merely bites his lip and moans, trying to ignore how his cock throbs with need.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*不知何人才是笼中人 *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*吴磊是知道吴亦凡的。但凡和这城中的魏、青、吴三大帮派世家扯上点关系的都知道他是青爷用诺大的偏堂做笼养起来的兔儿爷。青帮自民国时期开始就辈辈相传，到了青爷这代已经换到第四代帮主，锦绣楼阁雕梁画栋，换了几代帮主，这青府的园子就扩建几回。园子在变，定下的规矩不变，偏堂本是本家直系亲属的住所，自老祖宗辈就没变过，但是只因园中风景好，吴亦凡又喜清净，青爷便下了命令这片园子再不许他人踏足，吴亦凡自然是不了解其中门道的，他只知道这偏堂名字不好，位置也偏，虽说堂中风景如画，但是人烟稀少，他只当不受帮中待见，给他寻了处偏远的房子，但是了解其中门道的自然了然这位新主人的地位，也没人敢唤他做兔儿爷，旁人若是见着一回都得唤他声四太太。这些也是他幼时从多嘴的姨婆嘴中听说的，可信度有待考察，反正他见着吴亦凡的那回，没人喊他四太太，倒都是称他做吴先生。     吴磊第一次见吴亦凡时年纪还小，虽说他们是吴家的旁支，但是城中三大帮派聚会时还是少不了他们的一张请帖。具体细节他也记不太清，他只记得他嫌大人们的客套寒暄无聊便躲去花园扑蝴蝶。园子当时请的是国外的园艺师傅负责打理，他见园子里种植的灌木枝叶繁密，干脆就设计出了一座小型迷宫。吴磊当时追着一只蓝尾蝶无意间闯进迷宫中迷了路，当时天色已晚，只有院子里几盏昏黄路灯照明，寒风刺骨，虽说他自称小男子汉，心里也还是有些犯怵。他也不敢停下脚步，越走越急，最后竟是走入了迷宫的中心——一座白石修建的凉亭，亭中有一人身着白衣，臂抱白兔，直立月光之下好似天宫里的月神。     像是误入仙境叨扰仙子。     “小朋友你是迷路了吗？”仙子声音也温柔似水。     他晕晕乎乎的点点头，伸手想探仙子的衣袖，仙子笑着放去白兔牵起他的手，“走吧，我带你出去”     仙子的手又大又暖，能直接包住他汗湿的拳头，他送吴磊到大厅前拨弄好吴磊额前的碎发，和他说自己不方便进去，让他跟着几位侍从叔叔走，便没了踪影。他当晚回去后便发起了烧，一把野火将他本就不清晰的记忆烧的更加模糊，他只当那是自己做的一场梦，直到多年后他再次见到吴亦凡，他才确信那晚的月亮并不是水中幻影。     只可惜月亮蛊惑人心，兔子引起祸端。     吴磊父亲的死亡并不是偶然。彼时他正在大洋彼岸读书，前一秒还在和好友计划假期旅行，后一秒就接到钟叔的电话说家父遇难，他坐了连夜的飞机赶回来见到的也是他白发丛生的父亲躺在红木棺中走得一脸安详。     他是被青爷杀的，子弹穿过胸膛的时候他都来不及反应。     青爷想给他的小兔子修座月宫，正好看中了他家那片的后山，依山傍水，人杰地灵。吴磊的父亲自然是不愿意的，那是吴磊母亲的长眠之地，这事没有商量的余地。青爷是个狠人，三番五次沟通无果后，他便起了杀心，死人不会说话，也没法儿拒绝。     更何况吴磊家只是吴家一条血缘疏远的旁支，吴家近年来暗潮涌动内乱不断，少一户人家打扰更是一件好事，吴家本家自然不会插手阻止，于是在吴家几近默认的态度下，吴磊的父亲死在了他和青爷谈判的餐厅，连盘中5分熟的牛排都才只吃了一口。     钟叔是不愿意吴磊去复仇的，青帮根基牢固不是他一个小朋友能动摇的，更何况是位高权重的帮主，旁人想见上一面都难如登天。     吴磊没有应他，只是指尖轻轻翻动眼前的资料缓缓地说，“你还记得他前些年养过的那位兔儿爷吗” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*不想說明，只想反應。 —— 題記 *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*罗伊斯到访的时候，克罗斯正在给那把悬空木质躺椅做最后的抛光打蜡。他只穿了件宽松的工装裤，裤腰松松垮垮的挂在胯间，露出一身精壮的肌肉，汗津津的仿佛抹了油。他的胸膛随着沉重的呼吸而起伏着，那力与美的结合在他身上得到了完美的展现。  罗伊斯就站在不远处静静的看着他，眼神从他额前的湿发飘到手臂上隆起的二头肌，最后隐没在他工装裤的前端。克罗斯的裤子下面似乎什么都没穿，那里耸起着明显的形状并在克罗斯每一下的打蜡中晃来晃去。  罗伊斯感到自己的脸有些烫。这时克罗斯似乎是完成了整道工序，顺手扯下了厚实的手套，甩在一边后就朝罗伊斯走来，将他一把抱起放在了身后的工具台上，然后快速的扯下他的牛仔裤。  “你都把我看硬了。”隔着粗糙的工装裤，克罗斯拿坚硬的下体蹭罗伊斯的前端，“你得对它负责。”  罗伊斯被他委屈的口气逗笑了：“那我真是觉得由衷的抱歉。请问我能为它做点什么？”  “我要你现在就张开双腿，把自己的手指头伸到后面去，当着我的面自慰。”克罗斯抱着他的腰，右手在他光裸的大腿内侧滑行着，同时将头凑在他的耳边，轻轻啄着罗伊斯的耳垂说道。  “That’s all?”罗伊斯的前端在他的挑逗下已经微微挺立起来了。  “必须要到高潮。”克罗斯补充道，“然后握着我的阴茎，将它对准你发抖的小穴，自己插进去。一下一下，我要看着你操你自己。”  罗伊斯在听见他的最后一句话后，不易察觉的抖了一下。他立即顺从的照做了。  右手向后撑在桌子上，罗伊斯后仰着慢慢的张开腿，先是快速了撸了撸自己的阴茎，等上面的小嘴被玩的湿润，他就着那点润滑，顺着股间的阴影在蜜穴的周围画着圈。为了更好的将手指头插进去，罗伊斯将右脚抬起，踩在桌子的边缘，这样整个后穴就随着动作暴露在克罗斯的视线当中。似乎有些不好意识，罗伊斯侧着头不去留意克罗斯炙热的目光，将手指顺着蜜穴的褶皱慢慢的插了进去。  克罗斯往后退了两步，近距离的欣赏起这幅春宫图，同时拉下工装裤的拉链。裤子就这么滑到了靴子上，他赤条条的站在那里，就着罗伊斯自慰的刺激景象开始抚摸早已肿胀的分身。罗伊斯的两个手指头在自己身后进出着，偶尔刺激到那个小点的时候整个人会颤抖起来，耸立的前端更加激烈的向外渗着水。  “微微往左，再往上些，对，用指尖的力量刮擦那里。”克罗斯快速撸动着自己的阴茎，还不忘指点罗伊斯挑逗自己身体深处的开关。罗伊斯照着他的话动作着，很快就颤抖的不能自已。这时克罗斯突然伸手就着罗伊斯的的动作捅了一个手指头进去。  “啊！”  罗伊斯被这突如其来的刺激弄高潮了，他的分身一下子射出了一股浓液，大腿内侧也哆嗦的厉害。  “You are welcome.”克罗斯的手指头还留在罗伊斯的体内，有一下没一下的扫过那个突起。  “等等……啊……让我休息一下……”刚刚高潮的身体还敏感的很，罗伊斯被克罗斯的手指头逗弄的没有办法，只能喘息着努力往后缩去。  “第一部分算你合格了，接下来该轮到我了。”克罗斯的巨大颇具威胁性的在罗伊斯的蜜穴外轻轻的顶着，提醒着他自己的宝贝还虎视眈眈。  罗伊斯的身体还没完全从刚刚的高潮中恢复过来，不过还是按约定伸手抚摸起克罗斯那可观的巨物，然后摸索着将它对准自己的后穴，慢慢的推了进去。  不论发生过多少次关系，克罗斯的阴茎总不是个容易接受的大家伙。罗伊斯努力将自己的大腿撑得更开，好将那玩意儿一点点挪进身体里面。  好容易进去了大半，这个姿势实在不能将克罗斯全部吞下去。罗伊斯上半身用力，牵引着臀部就着这个深度动了起来。身下男人纤细而有力的大腿环着自己的腰，柔韧的腰肢操控着结实的臀部在桌子的边缘来回晃动，克罗斯感受得到包围自己的阴茎的温暖潮湿，那里的肌肉收缩着将他牢牢地包裹住。  真紧啊。  在罗伊斯又一次抬起自己的下体时，克罗斯反客为主的抓住他的腰，将他的下半身朝自己的前端拖了过去，然后将他的双腿抓住并拢，自己在更为狭窄的空间里快速的抽插起来。  “啊……慢……慢一点”克罗斯的阴茎全部插进去了，这个姿势比平时的来的更为不易，罗伊斯的后穴被紧压在一起，双腿不被允许刻意的缓解冲击的力度，而克罗斯的无休的撞击“啪啪”的打在罗伊斯紧绷的臀部，他只觉得有一股火焰从羞耻的部位流窜到他的脸颊，并蔓延到全身。  “Toni! Toni!”罗伊斯在只有他们俩的工作间大声的喊出克罗斯的名字，以期换取他的怜悯。那一声声柔软的呼喊听在克罗斯的耳朵里如同天籁之音，他加速冲刺了十几下，终于将自己释放在了罗伊斯的体内。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*晚上十点，我在床上翻来覆去怎么都睡不着，胯下的欲望十分猛烈，算起来我已经有半个多月没开荤了。 我的男朋友哪里都好，长得好看，学习优秀，声音好听，追上他的时候我不知道被多少人嫉妒。但他就是有一点不好，不但高冷还是个性冷淡。 我和他交往了半年多，才被男友十分嫌弃地用手帮忙纾解了一次欲望，一年后在我的软磨硬泡下男朋友才同意让我碰了一回。 “我们还没结婚呢，这样不好，而且这种事情做多了是会伤身的。”他总是这样说。 不管我如何解释憋着更伤身，他都不为所动，还一脸无辜地说，“为什么要憋着？你可以自己解决啊。” 但自己解决怎么比得上男友的身体！后来男友答应我一个月做两次，但这对于我来说远远不够。 翻了多次身后，我终于下定决心，打开电脑，进入了我保存了很久但没怎么去过的网站。 点击进入‘live cams’之后，出现了很多或清纯或妖艳的头像，排名第一的十分眼熟，居然是我的男朋友！ 这不可能，一定是什么和他长得像的人，我一边安慰自己一边控制不住地点开了他的头像。 但视频中那张熟悉的脸，耳机中传来的熟悉的声音，这一切都告诉着我，这就是我男友没错了。 他穿着高中生的制服，配上他稚嫩的脸娇小的个头，看上去真的像个高中生。 他和平时一点都不一样，带着耳麦，用沙哑又甜美的声音和每个给他刷火箭游轮的人聊着，脸上始终带着甜甜的笑，一点都不高冷。 看着他嘴里叫着哥哥，在镜头前又是撒娇又是卖萌的样子，我肚子里的火蹭蹭地冒上来。 我立刻抓了一件外套，叫了辆车，就往男友家赶去，一路上还用手机紧盯着直播。  坐上车的时候他已经脱去下身的裤子，把外套也脱了，只穿了一件白色衬衫，领带也被解开，虚虚地绕着脖子一圈，垂在他胸前。 他微张着大腿跪坐在床上，调整摄像头，镜头晃了一会被调整成了一个从下往上拍的角度，可以清晰地看到他白嫩的大腿根，而他两腿间的美好景色被衬衫下摆堪堪掩住。 弹幕里一片意淫我男朋友的言论，我烦躁地关掉弹幕，专心地盯着手机屏幕，虽然生气，但不可否认的是我的下身已经完全起反应了。 手机直播里，那个小妖精还顶着张清纯的脸在撒娇。 “谢谢boytoy欧巴送给我摩天轮，最喜欢boytoy欧巴了，来，亲一下。” 然后就噘着嘴冲着镜头去了。 “师傅，在下一个路口拐一下弯。”我说。 我记得那个街口有家情趣用品店，好不容易能玩一次，就要玩个大的。 “哎呀，大勋哥哥好讨厌，干什么要看别人的胸部啊？。。。就算哥哥送了六个跑车也不行哦，那里是隐私的部位。” 我咬着牙，撩吧，等会有你好受的。 他把镜头放在床上，面向着镜头趴下。 脸红红的，“要开始了。” 我正疑惑着开始什么，他就咬着嘴唇，把手伸到背后，微微翘起屁股，衬衫因为这个姿势而下滑到胸部，从镜头里可以看到他赤裸的腰和一点点白嫩的屁股。 “王嘉尔！”我咬牙切齿地念着他的名字，无法相信他居然真的这么做。 他把中指含到嘴里，用唾液润湿，就再次伸到后面，缓缓探入。 镜头里看不到他被进入的地方，但可以清清楚楚地看到他的表情，饥渴而淫荡，配上这张清纯的脸，矛盾得不得了。 他的手开始了缓缓的抽动，呼吸变得粗重了起来，眼睛里也迅速聚满了水汽。 就这样，他还要努力去读观众的留言。 “哈啊。。。不会让你们看到的，嘉嘉下面。。。嗯。。。只有男朋友可以看。” 我阴云密布的心情突然明朗起来，被这句话安抚得服服帖帖的，虽然男朋友在做这种直播，但是他心里是有我的。 “我的男朋友？当然是Henry哥哥啦。。。哈嗯。。。好喜欢你，Henry哥。。。” 我的笑容凝固了，Henry是谁？ “嗯。。。要。。。要到了。。。。啊啊啊！” 他手上的动作越来越快，然后能从镜头看到一点点喷出去的水花，全都落在床上。 高潮的过程大概有半分钟，然后他就抽出手指，趴在床上调整着呼吸。 “您到了，总共36元。”司机转头和我说。 我拔下耳机，拿出钱给了司机，等不及他找钱就下了车，直奔男友住的公寓去。 男友的公寓是我给买的，为表忠心，房产证上只写了他的名字，钥匙也应他的要求只配了他的，平时我来这里都会提前和他打好招呼他给我开门。 但其实我自己偷偷配了一把钥匙，以备不时之需，万万没想到，我第一次需要用钥匙居然是这种原因。 用钥匙打开门，我冲了进去，他被突然的响动吓了一跳，惊恐地看向我，电脑里的直播还没关掉。 “你。。。” 我阴恻恻地看了看他，把他看得一阵心虚，又看了看电脑里的直播界面，突然就笑了一下。 然后我走到电脑屏幕面前，“嗨，各位好，我是嘉嘉请来的特别嘉宾，今天的直播还有特别内容哦。今天的挑战主题就是，让一个不乖的小美人连续潮吹5次。” “你要做什么？！”他惊恐地大叫道。 我一把按住想跳下床的他，“那么我们开始吧。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*爆豪胜己前一晚因为第二天的课业而有所收敛，而清早将那串意义不明连成一串的珠子递来的时候，轰焦冻本就还睡的迷迷糊糊，在加上睡眼朦胧之时也只能瞥清那真的是撑不了台面的粗细，便也由着爆豪胜己去了。  而此时毫不显眼的小东西存在感十足，一刻不停歇的挑弄着敏感点。不知是由什么材质构成，那一长串随着他肠道的蠕动而变换着形状，小幅度的摇摆着。因为此时剧烈的运动而毫不留情的研磨着内里火热敏感的肠肉。  挺立的性器被训练服束缚在其中，无从发泄。拉珠仿佛有意识的在体内蠕动，并没有过分的刺激，甚至埋在后穴中也没有明显的感觉，却时不时以强硬的姿态带给轰焦冻如深海的波涛一般连绵的快感。  内里的穴肉食髓知味拼命绞紧了那不速之客，外涌的肠液却被肛塞尽数堵回。小幅度的动作也能让他清晰的感受到珠子在体内挤压着肠壁，在带来异样的饱足感时，被撩拨到欲火焚身却无处发泄的磨人涨的他脸通红。  被万众瞩目的感觉并不好受，一道道灼热的目光仿佛穿透他的训练服在窥探他本身。这使得轰焦冻不由的将注意力转移了另外的方向，前端无法宣泄的欲望反而放大了后穴中隐约的快感。不给人致命一击，而是细水长流的将致命的快感堆积。  相泽消太叫停了这场毫无意义的比试，轰焦冻下台的脚步甚至是虚浮的。在相泽消太宣布下一组名单时，轰焦冻远离人群，可以用蠕动来形容的几小步磨蹭到了爆豪胜己身侧。爆豪胜己穿校服的方式一向过分随意，轰焦冻轻扯了爆豪胜己没塞进去的衬衫下摆。  他的眼神甚至有些涣散，略有些茫然的对上爆豪胜己的目光。爆豪胜己不客气的啧了一声，之间拦腰将轰焦冻扛在肩上，有力的小臂锢着轰焦冻的腰来固定。轰焦冻试图挣扎，然而踢腿的动作只能让拉珠在体内活动的愈加猖狂。  “喂，这家伙个性使用过度了，我去帮他降温！”  上鸣电气作为这段关系的知情者之一，万分嫌弃的在爆豪胜己的背后竖了个中指：你也是火系好吧？刚才你们根本没用个性好吧？！  而爆豪胜己在身影在逐渐偏离众人的视线之后，用手也有意无意的隔着衣物贴着臀肉，恶意的向里揉搓。拉珠因为身子的颠簸而不断磨蹭着穴肉，虚虚实实不太真切的快感直涌上大脑。像是逆了水的人好不容易找到一块浮木，却频繁被汹涌的浪潮吞噬，周而复始毫无边际。  离宿舍还有一段距离，回去教室也是下下策。没有犹豫，爆豪胜己脚下生风的转入了更衣室，随后将门反锁住。他把轰焦冻放下，还未等轰焦冻站稳就将他逼至墙角，不由分说的扣住他的下颚含住了因为快感而微张的唇瓣。  却反倒是轰焦冻先探出了舌尖勾过了爆豪胜己火热的舌头，进而不知是谁开始的攻城略地争夺着主导权，唇齿交缠的水声回荡在空无一人的房间显得淫靡非常。爆豪胜己的气息混合着颇具威慑力的荷尔蒙，却轻轻将他包裹在了其中。  几乎是欲拒还迎的任由爆豪胜己粗暴的扯下了裤子，连带着拉链在爆豪胜己眼中都极其碍眼。他们的双唇紧密贴合，相较于接吻更接近原始的撕咬，粗暴毫无技巧，倾尽全力的去夺取对方的全部。但最终谁都没舍得让谁见血。  内裤已经被性器前端渗出的浸出一小块水渍，爆豪胜己的手顺着轰焦冻的腰线一路捋下，最后描摹着挺翘的臀型。轰焦冻的穴肉将拉珠绞紧，在爆豪胜己的将肛塞轻轻抽出时又争先恐后的挽留。  在窒息之前他们终于舍得放开彼此，数颗珠子接连不断的磨过敏感点，轰焦冻只得用从唇缝中挤出无意义的音节宣泄快感。爆豪胜己俯下身用牙齿研磨轻吻轰焦冻的耳垂，手下依旧缓慢的抽拉着拉珠，恶意的玩弄着花样，让尚留存在体内的珠子毫不留情的碾过敏感的软肉。  “焦冻。”单单的两个字节的低沉的嗓音回响在静谧的更衣室内，往昔高潮出神时流连的低音骤然盘绕在耳侧。在意识跟上步伐之前，身体已经条件反射的作出了判断，甚至没有对前端的安慰单靠后穴的刺激便射了出来。滚烫的白灼尽数爆发在爆豪胜己身前的衣物上。  高潮过后的身体致命的敏感，轰焦冻的眼底泛着生理的泪水，腿部仿佛失了力气。爆豪胜己撑着他的身体，将细碎的亲吻和安抚落于肩胛，直至轰焦冻颤栗的身子重归于平静。  爆豪胜己将拉珠整个抽出随意的扔在地上，黏腻的肠液将他的手浸的湿漉漉的。后穴已经被一天之中无形的这么扩张到极致，骤然袭来的空虚让娇嫩的肠肉饥渴的收缩，恋恋不舍的挽留着爆豪胜己的手指。  爆豪胜己有力的小臂撑着轰焦冻的双腿，一支力将他直接抱至半空。并且强硬的掰开柔软的臀瓣，直接一插至底，肠液顺着交合之处渗出，浸湿了轰焦冻的大腿内侧。轰焦冻的手臂紧紧环着爆豪胜己的肩膀，两条有力的长腿下意识之间盘住了他的腰。  所有的着力点都集中下身的相连之处，爆豪胜己将轰焦冻的背贴着墙壁，又不相信墙面的质地。最终虚虚实实的让轰焦冻整个挂在自己身上。  重力迫使轰焦冻将性器吞的严严实实，将拉珠没能抚慰到的地方轻松碾过。性器顶着软肉直达深处，将内里的褶皱抚平。肉壁的挤压使轰焦冻仿佛能够感受到性器的形状和灼热的温度，从尾椎涌上的快感直冲脑门，搅得大脑一片浑浊。  被操的软熟的穴肉熟练的吞吐着性器，快感的侵袭让穴肉更加的紧致，要命的吮吸着爆豪胜己深埋其中的性器。爆豪胜己咬住了轰焦冻外露的脖颈，在上面留下绯红的唇印。他已经无暇顾及这个位置除了高领无法掩盖的问题。  轰焦冻的低喘被爆豪胜己暴风雨般的攻势顶弄的支离破碎，粗肿的性器在小穴中整根没入而又整根抽出，不偏不倚的有力捣过敏感的软弱逼的轰焦冻的意识不受控制。挤压的肠液在地面上滩作一团水迹。  爆豪胜己身下劲力十足，要把轰焦冻捅穿似的，深深地往最脆弱敏感的地方闯。过电一般快感直达全身每一处的细胞，轰焦冻死咬着唇才能将出口的呻吟吞入腹中。  没人会料想到风头正旺的未来新晋英雄人气王，一向以冷淡和强硬的态度示人的轰焦冻。会毫无依靠的将全身的安危托付给一人，被顶弄的只能发出含糊不清的音节，却又咬紧了牙关不肯求饶。顶到深处的时候会带出如同小动物一般可怜的呜咽，柔软的腰肢在快感袭来的时候弓起。  他的下身和爆豪胜己的紧密贴合，小腿因为过分激烈的顶弄而轻轻发颤。  “话说是哪间来着？”突兀闯来的人声直接将轰焦冻的意识拉回，内里猝然绞紧差点让爆豪胜己缴械投降。  “走错了吧，那个房间是高三A班在用吧。”轰焦冻试图用眼神制止爆豪胜己的动作，而爆豪胜己选择搂紧他的腰变本加厉的顶弄。  “那可是被称作传奇的班级啊，去看一眼应该没关系吧？”语罢，反锁的门还配合的响了两声。他仓皇的想逃离却被爆豪胜己紧紧禁锢在怀里，脆弱的肠壁仍被过分的操弄，将轰焦冻的身子带动着上下起伏，若有若无的肉体相触的声音也不知是否是轰焦冻的幻觉。  “算了吧，他们训练也快结束了，快走快走。”轰焦冻提到悬崖边的心重归原位，他的理智逐渐被喧嚣的情欲吞噬殆尽，仅存的余念逼着他在意乱情迷只是还在慌忙的寻找着爆豪胜己的眼睛。直至清清楚楚的确认他的眼中所倒映的自己的模样。  他的后穴痉挛的绞紧，同爆豪胜己交换着无时无刻都汹涌着迸发的情感，直至一股滚烫尽数喷涌，仿佛要灼伤他的肠道。脚趾用力的蜷缩之后控制不住的射出，虚虚的蹭着爆豪胜己仅在咫尺的面颊，犹如一只餍足的猫儿。     爆豪胜己火速清理现场的时候，切岛锐儿郎在A班众人之中打着前锋。察觉到空气中一起微妙的氛围，他火速给上鸣电气递了个颜色，连蒙带骗的重新把大家拐了回去。  然后掐着时间派上鸣电气打探情况确定一切收拾妥当之后，雄赳赳气昂昂的推开了更衣室的大门。并在心里疯狂给爆豪胜己翻了几个白眼。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“在这做吧。”KT颇有兴致的说，1146的腰卡着不知为何存在的墙洞而动弹不得，显然是在游走时出的差错。而挺翘的臀部也因为挣扎的动作而轻轻的抖动。  这不算是询问，只是KT单方面的通知。他甚至伴着话音直接扯下了1146的裤子，有力的手抚上了暴露在空气之中颤动的臀部。  KT的吻细碎的落在紧致的臀肉上，在过分白皙的肌肤纹理上留下一串情色的痕迹。只是毫无技巧的单纯的吻而已，从臀部沿着背脊攀升而上的麻痹感却一阵阵的侵袭着1146的大脑。  湿润的舌尖在敏感的肌肤上游走，潮湿的舔舐之后，坚硬的牙齿咬上了他的臀肉。KT的力度把握的恰到好处，齿面细细研磨着，羞耻有如过电一般窜过1146的全身。掩藏其中的后穴因为紧张亦或是兴奋而饥渴难耐的收缩。  1146的眼角攀着一抹红色，死咬着曲起的手指好把仓皇逃逸到唇边的呻吟咽回。以他的立场对于劝说KT显然毫无说服力。隔着手套依稀的唾液浸湿外部布料的黏腻感臊的他颤栗起来，外露的肌肤染着不自然的樱粉。  尽管他的面前是一道无人的小巷，随时会被发现的无力感和完全受制于KT的失控，将身后的快感无限制的放大。仿佛被墙面阻隔在另一端的下半身的每一个细胞都是敏感点，KT的手贴着他大腿内侧，掌温要把他灼烧一般火热。  KT蹲下身，掰开1146的臀瓣，高挺的鼻尖蹭着1146挺翘的臀肉，呼出的灼热的鼻息野蛮的打着他敏感至颤动的臀肉。舌尖灵活的滑入收缩的穴口，肠肉蠕动着摆脱异物的侵入，最终在强势的力道推进之中缴械投降，吃里扒外的缠绕着吮吸着KT湿润的舌头。  KT的舌头在1146的肠道内横行，舔舐着抚慰每一寸的内壁。不时将舌头卷起用粗糙的舌苔抚平内里火热的褶皱。手也不停歇用指尖挑弄顶端，顺着缝隙勾磨转圈，一面逗弄着一旁被忽视依旧的可怜的囊袋。  舌尖在肠道中灵活的模拟抽插的动作，敏感的内壁一再绞紧却无法阻止那根不安分的舌头，最终只得任由塔在其中翻搅。  前端沁出的淫液打湿了KT的手指，而KT套弄的动作愈发的不知收敛，不像是抚弄更像是单纯的发泄。痛意夹杂着致命的快感席卷着1146的大脑，他的喘息就回荡在唇边却被最后的一寸理智拉回。  后穴的快感并不太真切，只有KT的口涎顺着柔软的肠壁一点点侵入深处。1146的呼吸急促，绷紧的腹部肌肉被禁锢在墙缝之间。他的腰被卡的严严实实，无从挣脱。前方那个毫无支力点，他只能用余下的手扣紧墙面，掩藏在手套内的指尖都染着鹰红，指下每一处都用力的贴紧着墙面。  肿胀发热的性器被KT握在手心，1146的理智丧失，断断续续的从齿间逃逸出含糊不清的字节。连带着腿肉肌肉都绷紧，全身上下仿佛都在用力，悠然而过的清风拂过淌着薄汗的皮肤，将他的敏感提升到极致。  第一股白精设在KT的手心，KT站起了身，就着手指将那股黏腻的白灼送入了饥渴挽留的穴肉之中。滚烫的性器急切的从解开的裤子里跳出，打着1146大腿内侧柔软的肌肤。炽热的硬物顶着穴口，一寸寸有力的深入，直直碾过那得不到安抚的软肉。  褶皱被撑开至极限，灼热的性器在脆弱敏感的穴肉内肆虐。KT的手卡着他腰侧，压着1146快速耸动着要，每一下有力的顶弄都放肆的蹂躏着脆弱的肠壁。敏感点被反复的顶弄，被操的红熟的穴肉食髓知味的缠绕着KT粗肿的性器。  KT可观的性器直抵深处,摩擦着内里的肠肉，同时坏心撮弄着前端的性器。前后夹击的快感使得1146的眼神涣散的扫着前方，耳畔一声熟悉的轻忽让他的穴肉猝然绞紧，就连呼吸都险些凝滞。  “1146....你被卡着了？”4849将帽檐压低，试图掩盖挂在唇角掩饰不住的幸灾乐祸的笑意。  “所以说你该减肥了，这墙把你挤的脸都红了。”2048姑且还有人性的蹲下打探，确定1146被卡的严严实实。他用手指戳了戳和墙面紧密贴合在一起的衣物，有些头疼的搓了搓手指。  敏感的腰部被外力逗弄加之过分的羞耻感，差的让1146缴械投降。而KT毫不自知的大力的抽送，卵蛋随着冲刺的动作拍打着已经被撞的通红的臀肉，不断分泌的肠液被顶至深处的巨物挤出，淋漓依附着1146的大腿内侧。清亮的水声和肉体贴合的声音毫无收敛，只是隔着墙面而有些失真。  “这墙有点高啊，我去另一端推你。”2048和4849交换了个眼神，捉摸着路线该从哪一段过去。1146全身的毛几乎都炸了起来，借着右腿的支撑，惊慌失措的挣扎起来，不管不顾的抬起左腿胡乱的蹬踢。KT烦躁的扣住1146的腿用手勾过，将他的膝盖抵着墙面，全靠着余下的一条腿支撑。  这下1146真的是任人宰割，KT大力的顶弄将他的身子都往前推了几分。  毫无章法的操弄逼得1146险些丢盔弃甲，而停留于身上两道灼热的视线更将他盯的浑身燥热。KT的硬物大开大合的深入其中，脆弱的腺体被不断的捣过，而此时狼狈不堪被更加强硬分开的姿势，这让穴口将巨物吞至更深。  KT几乎都能幻想出1146眼底一片氤氲的水雾，抵着双唇不让足以软骨呻吟逃窜出口。沾了湿汗的碎发胡乱的黏着他的额头，一向克制近乎冷淡的脸上因为自己而失身恍惚。想到这，似乎是不满这副诱人的模样被人看了去，每一次都仿佛要顶至心头的深入，青筋遒劲的性器破开娇嫩的肠肉，能感受到身体的主人不适的颤动。  “他交给我，你们先走。”最终KT还是忍不住发声了，受到惊吓的反而是4849和2048。4849不爽的啧了啧嘴，却被脸色尴尬的2048半托半就的拉走了。2048面色平静，耳唇却染上了一丝意义不明的红色。  1146只觉得刹那间连身子都软了下来，被KT扣住的双腿止不住的颤栗。肠肉欲拒还迎的吮吸着KT的性器，完全打开的内壁被每一下有力的摩擦而叫嚣着汁液四溅。狰狞的巨物在紧致的小穴内进出，毫无收敛的攻势逼的1146再也无法忍受。  交合的部位被肠液打湿的潮湿不堪，1146的难耐的仰起头，汗珠顺着他绷紧的面部曲线而下。最终后穴痉挛的收缩到了极致，吸辍着毫无发泄欲望的柱体。在KT愈演愈烈的攻势之下失了精关，高潮的快感如同深海的浪潮将他彻底吞没。  高潮过后的身体敏感的过分，1146含糊不清的呻吟依旧是不太高昂的低音，语调却已不由自护的挑上了几分甜腻。KT的每一下依旧毫不怜惜的捣过敏感点，如同接受一段永无终止的酷刑。白色的碎末黏着被操弄到红肿不堪的穴口，还反复吞没着肆虐已久的巨物。  1146疲软的性器被刺激的再度半软不硬的抬起了头，前端异样的饱足感又强调着这不知是快感而已。本就紧致的穴口在1146完全反应过来之时缩的更紧，阻截着KT的性器不让他离开分毫。  KT终于舍得在1146体内释放，滚烫的浓精打着敏感脆弱的穴道，无疑是另一种要命的刺激。而一股黄色的液体从1146前端可怜的颤动着的性器中涌出，在地面和溢出的淫水混成一滩水渍。  同时1146战栗着一直不断反抗的身子却终于恢复平静。察觉到不对劲的KT慌忙的松开禁锢住1146的动作，退出一阵凌虐的性器。混着肠液的白灼争相着从穴口溢出，将1146的下身弄得一片狼藉。  被硬生生逼到失禁的想法喧嚣着充斥着1146的大脑，眼角生理的泪水还弥留着一道水痕。KT一面小心避开1146一面打碎了墙面，将1146捞出来，将大脑皮层都搜刮平了才琢磨出一句安慰的话语。  “对不起，玩过头了。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*If anyone can find a way to look extremely stupid while accidentally telling their team mates that they are dating it's the two idiots *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*It all started at morning practice when Hinata and Kageyama absolutely refused to look at each other or even practice together. It was really confusing to the rest of the team, cause the day before they were practically hugging they were so close to each other. "Hinata, what's up with you and Kageyama? You won't even look at each other?" Tanaka being the ever dependable nosey senpai question.  "What's up is that Kageyama doesn't know how to listen! He completely ignored what I had to say yesterday!" "I didn't ignore you! Dumbass, I didn't even hear you sorry if you were stuttering so bad it was hard to understand!" Kageyama contradicted. "I wasn't stuttering! And you WERE ignoring me! Which is rude when you're boyfriend is asking you out on a date you shouldn't ignore them! And don't call me a dumbass Bakeyama!!!!!!!" Hinata burst. "Well then say it more clearly and you can't even set up a decent date your idea of one is going on a bike ride up the mountain!" Kageyama insulted, then froze. "YOU GUYS ARE DATING!!!!!!!!!" The entire team except Tsukishima shouted.  "And they acted like idiots the whole time." Tsukishima insulted grossed out. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Their fight had not interfered in their mission, which was  so fucking good  because Natasha would riot if a mission got endangered because of personal causes like that one. They were close to the end when it happened.  “Quick,” she had realized that a man was coming, wearing the uniform of the group they had infiltrated in. “hold my leg.”  Steve blinks, confused, but hears it too and understands.  This is for the mission, both tell themselves when he starts thrusting and she has only the wall and her partner’s arms to support herself.  Good thing he has enhanced strength. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*湾区之王 洛根×陆恪 隐all陆  杰伊吃早饭的时候，洛根坐到了他的对面。  “你昨晚带姑娘回来了吗？”洛根神神秘秘地问，“还是说你带小伙子回来了？”  “啥？”杰伊一脸茫然。  “算了吧，别装傻了。你昨天晚上叫得全屋子都能听得见——‘耶稣啊上帝啊，操，宝贝我爱死你了，操操操操！耶稣啊——’”  “你他妈闭嘴！”杰伊脸涨得通红，很小声地说，“不是的……是斑比……”  “你和斑比？！”  “都说你他妈小声点了！”杰伊把叉子扔回盘子，捂住了自己的脸，“操，不是你想的那样。昨天晚上我和斑比不是喝了点酒吗？他送我回房间休息，我们就他妈的聊天来着。我问他除了橄榄球还有什么特长，他想了回儿和我说——操，斑比肯定也喝醉了——他说其实他口活还不错。我说——我也喝多了——我说真的吗能不能证明给我看看，斑比就侧过身来，然后——”  “可以了！”洛根表情空白，“打住吧！求你了！”  他们默不作声各怀鬼胎地吃完了一顿早饭。当洛根魂飞天外状把自己盘子里最后一口煎蛋送进嘴里后，他终于按捺不住，小声问询：“所以……斑比的口活到底怎么样？”  杰伊脸上浮现出一种半是尴尬半是回味的扭曲表情。  “怎么说呢，”他回答，“够我回味到明年了。”  —————————————————————— 洛根的精神恍惚一直持续到他和陆恪返回了俱乐部，这时陆恪已经没法装着没看见了。  “洛根，”他狠狠推了一把自己竹马的肩膀，“你到底怎么回事？从你十三岁时把你爸的摩托车开进河里后我从没见过你这么不对劲！你怎么回事？”  洛根支支吾吾地犹豫了半天，终于一咬牙一五一十地交代了他和杰伊的对话，他打着哈哈：“杰伊这家伙开的玩笑太过分了，而且一点都不——”  “是真的。”陆恪理所应当地说，像看智障一样看着洛根，“我没告诉过你吗？”  这下洛根呆滞了整整十秒：“没有啊！”  “你在胡说，”陆恪指出，“我记得我们大学入学舞会那天晚上我就和你说过。”  “操，我以为你在开玩笑！你开玩笑的时候一直都很正经！”洛根一把捂住眼睛，“你先别说话，斑比，你让我冷静会……”  他是被裤链的响动吓得回神的。洛根一睁眼，就看见他的竹马已经自然地跪在他的面前，抬着那张像高中生一样阳光英俊的脸冲他笑笑，然后咬开了他的裤链。  “操——”  这是他能正常说出的唯一音节。  他硬的厉害的阴茎几乎是立即弹出来打在陆恪的唇边（上帝作证他自己都不知道自己什么时候勃起了），陆恪吹了声响亮的口哨，他还真是豪爽得不像个华裔，也不匹配他高中生的脸蛋。  陆恪的技术的确比他想象的高超百倍。他先是深情款款地舔了舔洛根的马眼，然后顺着茎身一路吻到睾丸，响亮地亲了一口，洛根光是看着他那张脸温顺又淫荡地贴在自己胯下就有种不真实的快感，而陆恪已经熟练地张开嘴努力把洛根的玩意儿吞到最深，颤抖的喉咙给了洛根一种无法表达的轻飘飘的愉悦，然后就开始时快时慢地吞吐起来。他跪坐着，一手顺着洛根的上衣下摆摸他的腹肌，另一手则摸索着自己的下体。  洛根剧烈地喘着粗气，两手死死绞在一块，他想到入学舞会的那个晚上他和陆恪在一个屋里互撸，陆恪舔他的喉结，很兴奋而愉快轻松地问他需不需要口活，他哈哈大笑地拒绝了——操，他后悔死了，这真的是太他妈的爽了。  陆恪微仰着头，他这会儿看上去没那么游刃有余了，精水和唾液顺着嘴角流出，把他的下巴打得亮晶晶的。他开始后悔没让洛根戴套了。  陆恪稍稍吐出来一些，只虚含着头部，舌尖戳刺着马眼，又飞快地在茎身下方的褶皱上用力擦过。他不轻不重地用牙齿刮了下包皮，在洛根惊叫出声之前用力一吮——  洛根过电般弓起腰，一把扯住他的头发。  他真佩服自己竟然还没有射出来。  洛根两眼泛红，低头看着陆恪，他的挚友皱着眉，下身在自己手里硬得厉害，脸颊和眼角已经红了。  他喊了声陆恪的名字，他知道陆恪明白他的意思，因为陆恪抬眼看他的眼神虽然潮湿，却带着揶揄的笑意。  他粗暴地把阴茎捅到了陆恪的口腔深处。  洛根近乎发狂地摆动腰部肏着陆恪的嘴，他扯着陆恪的头发，过了一会儿又在近乎掉线的理智下改为按着。他乱七八糟地说着一些半侮辱性的脏话，包括“婊子”“你他妈真是棒飞了”“我想肏死你”“你帮男人口交自己也有感觉是不是”之类的语句。陆恪模模糊糊地呻吟着，睫毛抖得厉害，他抚慰着自己，忍不住爱抚起自己的会阴和大腿根部。  洛根猛地抬起头，在陷入二十多年人生中最爽的一次高潮前拔出了自己的阴茎。  房间里只剩下两个年轻人的喘息。  洛根缓了好一会儿才找回自己被性高潮绞得稀烂的脑子，迷迷瞪瞪地低下头看陆恪，结果一瞬间红了脸——他刚刚是抵在陆恪的额角高潮的，一半精液沾染在他的脸上，挂在那睫毛上欲坠不坠，另一半则顺着他的发丝滑入他的头发深处。陆恪眼角红如血色，表情看上去还有些晃神。  洛根扯着他的肘把他拉了起来，给了他一个兄弟的吻。  陆恪很快恢复了神智，一把把他推开：“恶心死了。”他笑着说，用手背抹了一把脸，“我去洗澡。”  洛根摸了摸他的脖子，陆恪走了两步突然回过头来，冲洛根装模作样地眨眨眼睛，那滴精液顺着他脸颊像泪水一样滑了下来。  “所以说，”陆恪问，“你觉得怎么样？”  “怎么说呢，”洛根回答，“值一个超级碗。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*女装？ *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“朱丽叶？”提伯尔特甫一打开门，便被站在阳台处那红裙金发的背影晃了心神。 不，不可能。朱丽叶早已与罗密欧远走高飞，是他自己亲手送她走的。她有着美好的爱人和尚未开展的人生，她不可能回来。 玛格丽特？卡普莱家红裙金发的女孩不止一个，然而他只能记得玛格丽特。但她也不是玛格丽特，玛格丽特并没有这样的卷发。 罢了。 夜风吹起了窗边的纱帘，也吹起了女孩的裙摆。裙摆袅袅，他甚至还能闻到那阵熟悉的香气。提伯尔特一下陷入了无限松软又肿胀的温柔中去。只当是在梦里吧。 那人的转身却撕碎了他的梦。提伯尔特看到那张脸就厌恶。他脸上七扭八扭的笑容让提伯尔特想吐。 提伯尔特皱着眉头，问：”你干什么？” 来人好像品出了提伯尔特言语中那点来不及收回的情绪，像狼犬嗅到了肉一般高兴：“呀？失望了？” 茂丘西奥装模作样地看了看自己，学着朱丽叶的样子转了一圈，一脸虚假的无辜：“我还以为你会喜欢呢，哥哥。” 这声黏腻的”哥哥“惹怒了提伯尔特，他走过去一把打掉茂丘西奥的金色假发，抓起他胸前的领子，咬牙切齿：“你信不信我掐死你。” 茂丘西奥双手放开，侧着头看提伯尔特，没有一点害怕的神色。他丢掉那特意捏出的假嗓，换上自己的原声：“我以为你会感谢我？” “除非你死了。” 茂丘西奥笑：“哈哈，话不要说得太满。” 提伯尔特推开他，转身回房，厌烦地抚着额头。茂丘西奥不怕死地跟上去，靠在提伯尔特的床头：“我来给你一个抒发感情的机会。”他提着裙侧着头，捏起的假嗓刺耳得像只被阉割的鸡：“怎么样，哥哥。” 提伯尔特反手就是一巴掌，扇得茂丘西奥空了几秒。提伯尔特说：“你要发疯，滚回你的蒙太古去。” 茂丘西奥抬起来，轻笑了一声，眼里却没半点笑意：“罗密欧都跟朱丽叶走了，我回去干什么？” 提伯尔特把他推到墙上，手掐住他的脖子：“你再说一次这个名字，我就弄死你。” “哪个？罗密欧？还是朱丽叶。哦，当然是朱丽叶，你的宝贝。” 提伯尔特眼睛发红，手越收越紧：“茂丘西奥，是你自己找死。” 茂丘西奥能感受到脖子间的压力陡然增大，他的呼吸变得困难。他涨红了脸，嘴里说出的却仍然是羞辱提伯尔特的话。就好像羞辱提伯尔特是茂丘西奥的使命，哪怕是最后一句遗言，他也要将它用在嘲笑提伯尔特上。 “你不会杀死我的，我现在......穿的是，朱丽叶的裙子。” “承认吧.....你......喜欢……朱丽叶……” 提伯尔特手不断收紧，看着茂丘西奥的脸渐渐涨成紫红色。茂丘西奥的腿开始挣扎，在他真正昏死过去之前，提伯尔特松开了他。 大量的新鲜空气涌进茂丘西奥的肺部，他条件反射般护住自己的脖子，弯下腰大声咳嗽起来。 咳嗽和干呕的声音让茂丘西奥自己都嫌恶心。他甚至还没理顺呼吸，便扬起脖子对提伯尔特继续说他刚刚还没说完的话：“你亲手送走了她。你让她和你最讨厌的人远走高飞。真伟大啊，提伯尔特竟然是一个情圣，全维罗纳有几个人能相信呢？” 提伯尔特别过头去，不想听他说。茂丘西奥依然喋喋不休：“提伯尔特，你太可怜了，可怜又可悲。躲起来自我垂怜，躲起来舔舐自己。情圣？我呸。”“你只是一个没勇气争取的懦夫。你哪里有受伤的资格？我蔑视你，我唾弃你。隐忍而自我感动的单恋，哈，真可笑。你就继续躲在你的角落里烂下去吧，谢天谢地朱丽叶永远都不会知道她哥哥喜欢她。如果她知道的话，她该会觉得恶心。” 提伯尔特忍无可忍，走过去开始撕他的裙子。茂丘西奥还在说：“恼羞成怒，开始施暴了？还是说你已经想了很久了？‘轻轻褪去她的衣裳’什么的，天啊。” 提伯尔特从他胸前开始撕起，没几下，茂丘西奥身上的裙子便轻而易举地被撕成了碎片。提伯尔特拿起一块碎布狠狠地塞进茂丘西奥的嘴里，让他瞬间丧失了说话的能力。他反剪他的双手，拿起布条粗暴地捆住，也不去理会因为帮得过紧而瞬间被勒出的红痕。他把茂丘西奥扔到床上，把背部翻上来，用拉开他的腿就要进去。 没有润滑过的甬道又干又涩，卡得提伯尔特进退两难。提伯尔特又一挺身，狭窄逼仄的空间让提伯尔特疼痛。他知道茂丘西奥也痛，他们俩都需要这点疼痛。惩罚自己，折磨他人。 提伯尔特一边艰难地抽动，说：“你不配......你不配穿她的衣服，你不配提她的名字。” 茂丘西奥分泌出来的肠液让提伯尔特的动作变得顺滑起来。提伯尔特说：“你不过也是一条狗。什么爱情自由疯狂，呵。” 提伯尔特握住他的腰，疯狂抽插起来。他闭上眼，假装看不见眼前因为疼痛而挣扎的茂丘西奥。 …… 提伯尔特射在了茂丘西奥的体内。他缓缓退出，把身上留有的那一点白浊擦在了茂丘西奥的屁股上。他冷静地提好裤子，站了起来。 茂丘西奥侧着躺在床上，头发凌乱地散落在床上和脸侧，像死尸一样一动不动。提伯尔特好像看到茂丘西奥的睫毛上有一点泪光，但是他坚信自己看错了，茂丘西奥不会哭泣。 走出房门之前，提伯尔特还是忍不住往他身上扔了块破布。  “把它擦了。”提伯尔特说。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*这是什么玩意，我没写过这个。 *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*　　瓦肯帝国的第264代皇子S'Chn T'Gai Spock在最后一次释放后，推开了身下的伴侣。这是他今夜的第245个女人，第472个性伴侣。窗口已亮起微光，还有不到两个小时就要天明了，他需要休息。  　　“Spock殿下……”女人主动贴上来，似乎还意犹未尽。  　　“滚开。”Spock说道。“你以为你是谁？”  　　女人惊慌失措地逃走了。愚蠢的女人，她们满脑子都只想着自己的钱。Spock厌恶地看着床单上欢爱时留下的湿痕，心中感到一丝厌倦。作为瓦肯帝国未来的继承人，每晚都有25630个姿色美丽的男女供他挑选，可是这些都不能填补他心中的空缺。  　　他在500平方米的床上翻了个身，将沾上污渍的七彩镶钻床单扔到黄金砖块铺就的地上。就算他是将要坐拥宇宙第一瓦肯帝国的皇子，拥有35467680个恒星系的统治权，住在200000平方米的宫殿里，穿着价值4000000信用点的内衣裤又如何？他的内心仍然感到无比的空虚。  　　Spock心中烦闷，下床上了个厕所。厕所由全宇宙最顶尖的设计师耗时60年纯手工打造，使用了236490吨黄金，耗资36480亿。他坐在镶嵌着100000颗红宝石和蓝宝石，按照瓦肯人体工学设计的黄金马桶上，顺利地完成了排泄。“来人，”他用低沉威严的声音命令到，“为我净臀。”  　　他可是瓦肯帝国未来的皇子，宇宙未来的终极统治者，岂能用高贵的双手碰触秽物？话音刚落，一个金发蓝眼的人类双手捧着价值30万信用点的彩虹色镶钻厕纸，毕恭毕敬地向他走来。Spock非常满意，他觉得这个人类的外表令人赏心悦目。  　　他把臀部伸向人类，示意他开始擦拭。人类拿起价值连城的厕纸，开始洁净Spock的皮炎。这厕纸每一面都镶嵌着23650颗钻石，每颗钻石都经过纳米级表面处理，有着按摩皮炎，皮炎美容的功效。  　　然而，就在这么做的时候，人类不禁怔住了。当他的目光落到Spock的皮炎上，他再也无法移开自己的目光。啊，世上怎会有如此美丽的皮炎！它的色泽是如此艳丽，表面是如此的富有弹性，形状是多么地规则！更不可思议的是，它的每一道褶皱里都镶嵌着2369560颗微型钻石，每颗钻石都散发着瓦肯帝国第236代御用调香师耗时两个世纪调制的皇家香氛气息！  　　人类震惊不已，久久无法回过神来。Spock感到有些不耐烦。“人类，我的耐心是有限度的。”  　　“对不起，王子殿下，”人类说道，“您的皮炎实在太过美丽，我实在是情不自禁！”  　　Spock愣住了。什么，这个小小的人类净臀工，居然有如此的眼光和鉴赏能力！这么多年来，Spock的心结第一次被打开了。终于，终于！他每年花六个月的时间进行皮炎美容，每个月在皮炎保养上的花费超过50000000万，都是为了什么？他见过的每一个人都急于向他展示自己的皮炎，可是有谁认识到他的皮炎的美丽？Spock感到自己深深爱上了眼前的人类，他就是自己梦寐以求的那个人！  　　“我爱你，”他告诉那个人类，“你叫什么名字？”  　　“我是Jim Kirk，”人类深情地说，“我也爱您的皮炎。”  　　Spock感到无比的快乐和满足。他示意人类转过身去，他要赐予这个他深爱的人类全宇宙里至高无上的恩赐。他拿出价值2364890万元的秘制植物精油，用他每天花235万精心呵护的高贵手指润滑了Jim的皮炎，然后用镶嵌着4563970颗精心挑选之后又打磨光滑的孔雀石的基霸，刺入了Jim的身体。  　　这是他这辈子最满足的一次性爱。在此之后，他将Jim带到500平方米的床上，激动地向他展示了自己皮炎的另一美妙之处。只见Jim用一支手电筒照亮了Spock的皮炎，美妙的反射立刻在漆黑的室内制造出一个散发着昂贵香料气息的的小宇宙。原来，Spock皮炎中的都钻石经过精细的光学打磨，光线经过它们折射之后将呈现出美轮美奂的图案。  　　Jim不禁愕然——在黑暗之中悄然浮现的，是瓦肯帝国疆土中4319737319735颗遍布银河系的恒星排列出的美妙图景，象征着瓦肯帝国永不衰落的荣耀！他感到自己深深爱上了这个皮炎里装着宇宙的男人！  　　有生以来第一次，Jim明白了人生的真谛。他决定要用一辈子的时间守护Spock的皮炎，这宇宙中最珍贵的造物。从此，他悉心研究皮炎保养的技术，研制出了钻石皮炎补水膜，光子皮炎美容仪，纳米皮炎保湿水等高科技产品，为宇宙的皮炎美容事业作出了巨大的贡献。  　　1000年过去了，我们仍能在歌颂伟人的书本中读到这个故事。Jim一生阅皮炎无数，但他始终忠于Spock的皮炎，从未变心。而Spock也永远爱着这位来之不易的皮炎知己，与他厮守一生。净臀工Jim在Spock王子美丽皮炎的感化下成为一代皮炎大师的传奇故事，被整个宇宙的亿万人们传为佳话。资深史学家McCoy教授深受触动，用一本1000万字的著作记录下了这段可歌可泣的历史：《从净臀工到皮炎专家——一段从镶钻皮炎开始的爱情史诗》。 *~*TEXT*~*

Kissing, nipping and nuzzling.  She loves to kiss, soft brushes, nibbles, long lip-locking sessions that leave them aching.  Her legs lock around his waist, squeezing, one shoe drops as the other dangles.  His arms support her, pressing her closer welcoming her heat after such a long winter. He steals her breath burying himself so deep. He sometimes forgets her strength as she grips both his hands for purchase yet she trusts his strength losing herself in him.

*~*TEXT*~*His hair, the ground, his Gear itself whatever its name - Weltall, Weltall-2, Xenogears itself.  Red as blood.  His hands, those claws.  Red as blood.  His true nature, as he had found it once again.  Red as blood that poured from bodies they shredded, bodies that fell to the energy bursts he could still unleash without a thought.  Pathetic people, all of them - even friends, had tried to kill him once more, to make him just a part of this weaker being he had to protect.  Red as blood.  Id laughed, and licked blood off the claw.  The fallen seed blossoms.  ===  Elru, Lahan, Etrenank, too much.  What now, it had always been too much.  To make it all one, had been so much that the shock had held him together, numbly, just moving on because he had to, he had to fulfill his destiny, he had to save his friends, he had to do what he needed to do.  He hadn’t been strong enough.  He’d never been strong enough.  Now, he would finally be strong enough.  He would take control.  He would end the cycle…  Xenogears’ self-destruct, a manual option rather than mental link as failsafe.  Fei did not need it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Kiku and her friends get trapped in a mysterious place. While they were exploring, something happens to one of the friends. Oh my! What a disaster! *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*I woke up in a dark room with the Ken's Gang (Ken, Maddie, Stix, Lily, Eliza, Myst, me, and Dreamy). We couldn't get out, so we decided to explore the place using Ken's flashlight. Suddenly, we hear a noise from upstairs. We ran upstairs and Ken kicked the door open to see nothing. We went past the room, but before we could go anywhere, we hear Maddie screaming and the door slamming shut. We attempted to open the door but to no avail. After the screams were no more, Ken finally managed to kick the door off its hinges, but it wasn't a happy ending like in those fairytales.   "Oh my! What a disaster!" Dreamy screams.  There was a puddle of acid on the floor beside Maddie's foot and her flesh was literally burning away. Ken walked over to Maddie, took her hand, and smeared her blood on his cheek while keeping his shocked expression. We were disturbed and confused. He then proceeded to smear more blood onto his face.   "You're right Mamma...a disaster indeed," he says. Ken was coming for me next, but before he could, I woke up in my bed.  "...whoa...what a disaster..." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"I heard you're going to open up a business at the border to China." Yukimura looked up at him, a small frown coming to his face. "Rumor-news travels fast." Yanagi stood tall, no hesitance in his stance, just like the perfect image he was supposed to uphold for the general public. "I want to head it." "What about your position here?" "Give it to someone else. Won't be hard. Besides, you have Kunimitsu now, don't you? I hear he did a pretty good job, for a sensei. Might as well put him up for it." "It was his choice. And yes, he did well. Very well. And you would do well in not insulting him again like this." "He's yours now anyway. No point. So, do I get the job or not?" Yukimura's lips thinned at the tone of voice, so much like Niou's but Niou would never have meant disrespect with it. "You're leaving in the morning. And Renji, even if you do run that facility in the future, you still answer to me. Never forget that." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Akutsu finally gets some real action - within boundaries. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*"That was entertaining." Tezuka's answering smile was grim. The two of them standing amidst a myriad of bodies, every single one shot to death. "I wouldn't have called it that." Akutsu smiled, coming closer to where Tezuka was. "You know my tastes. Besides, I still think we should have used a small bomb at least." Tezuka sighed. "Fast and assured deaths, Jin. Or not at all." "Of course, sensei." Akutsu even mock-bowed, earning himself the immature slap he deserved. But he didn't reciprocate. Not tonight. Tezuka had surpassed even his wildest dreams and therefore earned a bit of slack. A bit.  "We should get out of here. The clock is almost through." Tezuka nodded and, after having put the gun back into its holster, picked up the guest book in the entrance area which promptly earned him a laugh. "The extra touch?" "A gift for oyabun." When they made their silent exit, Akutsu couldn't help but watch his lover a little more intensely.  Tezuka had changed.  And soon, so would his role in oyabun's household.  Akutsu was sure of that.  Very entertaining indeed. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Tezuka has to make up his mind. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*When Tezuka finally put down the phone, after confirming what he had found out through a different source, his body almost trembled with rage. It was unspeakable. Who in their right mind could expect to not fall prey to the duty of an avenging angel with circumstances like these? Tezuka didn't know the answer to that. He only knew that he was not going to let this slide. Not a chance. Fortunately, his lover immediately picked up on the mood, leaning against the doorframe of the now closed entrance, waiting for Tezuka to make up his mind about what he was willing to do. "Teach me how to shoot a gun." The words were forced into polite tones, despite it being an order. Akutsu hated orders, especially pointless ones. This however was a rather interesting one and might even provide entertainment.  Considering the stance his lover still held, the stiffness that seemed to cling to every curve, whatever he had found out would not be trusted to anyone else. Very interesting indeed. He nodded towards the door. "Shooting range. Now." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Allura is embarrassed. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“It’s nothing to be embarrassed about,” Hunk said, although he was aware that his voice was bashful, as he nuzzled into Allura’s neck. “Plenty of people have that problem. We all technically wear them when we’re in the lions, since they don’t exactly come equipped with bathrooms.”  	Allura sighed, as his hand slid over the front of the thick diaper, pressing right where she was sensitive.   	“It’s… seen as juvenile,” she murmured.  	“I think it’s adorable,” Hunk said, and she sighed again. “Do you want me to… do you want me to change you?”  	She was blushing as she nodded. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*前脚他进家门，喻文州刚刚将门关上，黄少天就急匆匆的和他接吻。黑暗中，这个吻比起之前的那些显得更加急不可耐，黄少天一手搂住喻文州的脖颈，另一手伸进喻文州宽松的卫衣在他腰际摩挲。黄少天跌跌撞撞的向前迈了一步，碰开了一排灯，小小的前厅顿时大亮。两人呼吸近在咫尺之间，温热的呼吸让人心里像被小勾子勾了一下似的。如此凑近了看，黄少天才发现喻文州的眼睛漂亮得不得了：眼型偏向细长，眼尾微微向上翘起，颇有种公子哥的感觉。公子哥这三个字一出现，黄少天脑海中就浮现出喻文州穿着青灰色长衫，长发大部分挽起来，一些碎发披散在肩头，鼻梁上架着金丝框眼镜，一双桃花眼眯起来，颇有种拒人千里之外的感觉，而他手中半摇不摇的折扇又在引他过去。 黄少天想着想着有些出神，忽然那只在喻文州腰际的手被他紧紧抓住，一路牵着黄少天的手一寸一寸的抚摸过去。黄少天可以感觉到喻文州滚烫的皮肤和利落的线条，腰间绝没有一丝赘肉但也并不瘦弱，看来是经常去健身房。喻文州牵着黄少天的手划过胸口，黄少天甚至能够感觉到他有力跳动的心脏。喻文州腾出一只手来将两人的上衣都脱去，黄少天身高比喻文州稍稍矮一些，肌肤相贴时胸膛对着胸膛，黄少天搂着喻文州的脖子和他继续亲吻，喻文州按着他的腰后又向上揉弄他的乳尖，一开始二人都不得要领，之后喻文州手法越来越娴熟后黄少天也能感受到一丝过电般快感。 两人都被彼此撩拨得起了欲望，虽然隔着裤子，因为离得过分的近，性器依然时不时摩擦砥砺。一来二去，连粗糙布料都被前端的液体浸湿出痕迹，两具肉体生涩的交缠，场面淫靡不堪。喻文州一路向下亲吻至锁骨，留下一串桃色温柔。第一次被咬上乳尖的感觉刺激得过分，黄少天忍不住仰头喘气，偏偏喻文州动作不紧不慢却就是不停，一只手抚摸黄少天流畅的腰线，另一只手轻轻的弹了弹黄少天的下体，抬头笑着低声说道：“怎么样？” 喻文州的声音变得低沉又富有磁性，在哪里都是要命，半晌后黄少天憋出一句：“喻文州，要做吗？”喻文州没有回答，而的吻一路向下，双手一边将黄少天下身衣物脱去。黄少天暗骂了一句，欲立不立的性器脱离了内裤束缚弹在喻文州嘴边，喻文州抬头看了他一眼，然后慢慢含住。 高热的口腔包裹住性器的感觉简直爽得要命，喻文州以舌尖舔弄，由于角度的关系，黄少天只能看见喻文州在他小腹处低头动作，颇有些认真的神色。不知怎么他竟然和训练室里盯着电脑的喻文州联系在了一起，画面顿时更加情色不堪。黄少天将头向后仰，抵在身后的墙壁，大口呼吸。光是喻文州赤裸着身体跪伏着这样的场景，就让他觉得自己的理智仿佛已经被一场大火燃烧殆尽，偏偏喻文州的手上也是不停，口腔和指尖的触感让他几乎站不住，仿佛在快感与刺激边缘走钢索。 黄少天快要射出来的时候喻文州改为用手，精液大部分射在地板上，小部分沾在喻文州的面颊和胸口上。喻文州缓缓的站起身，用手指刮去液体向臀缝探去。还未进入过的穴口紧闭着，对于忽然造访的异物很是排斥。喻文州一面亲吻黄少天的唇角，一面耐心的开拓后穴。喻文州用二指在他后穴戳刺，爽得黄少天连指尖都颤抖。 黄少天被后穴快感刺激得猛地又将前厅的一排灯撞灭，只留下客厅的一盏灯还孤零零的亮着。陷入黑暗只不过是徒增情趣，就好比缚手蒙眼一般。喻文州一边凑近他耳朵轻声低语，一边手上动作不停。说的都是些下流话，他还披着这么一副斯文样子的皮，一双桃花眼似笑非笑的看着黄少天。黄少天被喷吐在耳垂上的温热气息弄得不太自在，想挣脱却发现被喻文州紧紧的箍住了腰。他愤愤地低声骂了喻文州两句，刚刚不主动现在又这么下流，而听起来却像是缠绵情话。喻文州又轻声笑了一下，低头含住黄少天的耳垂：“我喜欢少天主动，比如说刚刚在门口的时候。”他舔吻又轻轻撕咬，好像含在口中的是鲜嫩多汁的果子而不是某个敏感得要命的部位。 黄少喉咙中发出不自觉的呜咽声，反驳的话语都成了破碎的闷哼。他眼角发红，好看的不得了，像是落了一朵桃花。两人贴在一起又磨蹭了好一阵，喻文州安抚性地亲吻了一下黄少天的额角，将他转过身对着墙壁，性器有一下没一下的戳刺着他的臀缝。黄少天又被他卡住腰间，只好扭动身躯，几乎全身都覆在墙上。 喻文州猛地一挺身，性器挤开滑腻肠壁长驱直入，黄少天一半是疼，一半是爽，尾音都颤得变了调。喻文州尝试着动作了一下，随即听到黄少天发出一声短粗而黏腻的喘息声，似乎又是在骂喻文州，听起来却像极了法文情话。黄少天高仰着头喘息，挺拔的鼻梁和下颌以及喉结组成一条利落优美的线条。喻文州确实是一个很好的情人，伸出一只手帮黄少天垫住额头怕他磕到墙壁。二人磨蹭了一阵终于得了要领，层层内壁谄媚堆叠，黄少天故意以舌尖舔弄喻文州垫他额头的手心，又轻轻吻住手指，急急的含在嘴里，喻文州将手指在他灵活的舌尖搅动。 划过内壁某一点时，黄少天忽然拔高声调哼了一声。黄少天耳廓发烫，眼眶又是潮湿的，看什么东西都模模糊糊一片，受了刺激后，一阵过电般快感从脊椎窜上大脑忽的炸开，便急急忙忙转过头来和喻文州接吻。他们坦诚相待，黄少天的乳尖被喻文州揉捏得红肿不堪，温热后穴淌出水还紧紧包裹着喻文州的性器。喻文州轻轻咬住黄少天的肩膀，用牙齿像动物般撕扯，标记领地似的留下浅浅的牙印。 白浊射得那片墙壁上到处都是，黄少天弓着身子喘气，脊背覆了一层薄汗，颇有一副狼狈不堪的样子。喻文州往里挺了挺腰，箍住黄少天虚虚扶在墙上的手腕继续动作。黄少天两次下来有些头昏脑涨，几乎是无意识的附和着喻文州的节奏，好让性器进入的更深一些。喻文州将头凑近黄少天，伸出舌头舔了一下有些干裂的嘴唇，吮吸下唇一阵后轻轻的咬了一口。黄少天被他弄得昏头昏脑，后穴几乎是麻了，只是靠着本能配合他。 黄少天的喘息声短粗而急切，喻文州射出来的时候他的双腿已经开始发软。接着喻文州轻柔的退出来，黄少天理所当然一般回头索吻。黑暗中两人将汗津津的额头抵在一起，对视，然后接吻。 *~*TEXT*~*

Until finally... " Yes!

*~*TEXT*~*    “He beat a man to death.”  These are the first words I register as the rage slowly recedes while I kneel on the floor. Every fibre of my being rebels against this act of submission. Having threats at my back is unacceptable.  I know I should regret it, feel ashamed and guilty. But I don’t. I can clearly picture the shocked and horrified face of my wife and son. But I just feel satisfaction. I look over to where my target lies, unmoving. I try to keep my face blank, but I can feel the smirk that I can’t suppress. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*”He’s feisty,” Mason Verger said and looked at the collared man at Will Graham’s feet.  “Yes,” Will said and yanked experimentally at Hannibal’s chain.  The slave glared daggers at Mason, but his gaze was fond when it reached Will.  Will gave him a small kick for his impertinent behavior.  “Why doesn’t he kiss your feet?” Mason asked.  “Do it,” Will said and felt a tingle of excitement.  Will removed his shoe and let the man put his tongue to work. He tingled with each swipe of that tongue. His slave was eagerly going to work and now he was aching with desire.  “Good boy,” he said and shoved Hannibal away. Mason chuckled to himself. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Neither had been able to sleep, they laid in silence for a while. Occasionally one would shuffle or switch positions in attempt to get comfortable but nothing seemed to be lulling either to sleep.  Steve broke the silence first, “ Tony?  I can’t sleep.”  It was quiet for a moment before Tony rolled over the face Steve, “neither can I…”  No one said anything else, they listened to the sound of the AC rumbling.  “Do you want to fuck,” Tony said bluntly, it was less of a question and more a comment to the room.  “I said I couldn’t  sleep  Tony, not that I was horny.”  “Okay yeah but,” Tony danced his fingers along Steve’s arm, “it tires you out yea? So we could…y’know. And then bam, sleep.”  “You’re ridiculous.”  “That wasn’t a no,” Tony pointed out.  Steve was silent for a long time before softly saying, “no, it wasn’t a no.”  Tony smiled to the dark room, he pressed a kiss to what he hoped was Steve’s cheek before turning away to rummage around in his night stand for a bottle of lube. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*"Hey now, let me see those beautiful blues" *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“Hey now,” Tony’s soft voice filled the room, “look at me, I want to see those beautiful blues.” It wasn’t a demand, a kind suggestion. Steve moved his hands away from his face and Tony smiled down at him as soon as he could see Steve’s face again.  “Hey there,” Tony’s smile was soft and, in his eyes, Steve could see there was love there, “you’re so handsome.” And the way Tony said it made Steve believe it, believing he was actually as handsome as people told him, because Tony wouldn’t lie to him about that. Tony never lied about that.  Steve presented Tony with a small smile in return, face soft, blue eyes shining bright.  Tony rocked back down onto Steve’s cock a few more times, smile never wavering.  His hands shifted to hold Steve’s ribs, thumbs flicking up on Steve’s nipples.  “There’s so many things I want to do to you, but most of all, I want to see how pretty your o-face is,” now the smile became more of a smirk and Steve’s face flushed red for the first time since Tony had bottomed out on his cock. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Steve,  hey Steve, ow,  oh gosh, babe,  hold on.”   Steve stopped moving as soon as he could hear Tony’s discomfort.  “Tony? What is it?” He leaned back to take in Tony’s apologetic face.  “I don’t think this is gonna work. I’m – ah – I’m cramping up,” Tony told him, reaching for his leg that was held high up on Steve’s bicep.     Steve lowered his arm, letting Tony’s leg slip down back to the floor.  “Thank you,” Tony sighed in relief. Steve pulled himself out of Tony and took a step back, providing more space for Tony to stretch his leg out.  “Sorry babe.”  “No, it’s okay, it was something new and it didn’t work.” Steve quickly said.  Tony barked a laugh, “you can say that again, I was standing on my tippy toes  and  getting a cramp in my other leg.”  “Thank you for trying,” Steve gave him a small genuine smile.  “Hey now, we don’t have to stop there, I’ve still got an erection and…” Tony trailed off as he looked down to Steve’s sizable cock that was standing at attention.  Steve laughed and crouched to lift tony up off the ground to carry to the bed. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*His face relaxed and his mouth hung open wide. It was one of Tony’s favourite sights. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Steve pushed into Tony’s thighs in long slow thrusts, his face relaxed and his mouth hung open wide. It was one of Tony’s favourite sights.     He lay on his back, head propped up on pillows to enjoy the view. Legs pressed tight together, feet placed lightly in either side of Steve.  Sunlight slipped through the crack in the bedroom curtains so a bright line stretched its way across Tony’s thighs, right where Steve’s cock poked through. Lube and sunlight made the head sparkle and Tony was lost to the sight of it.     Occasionally Steve’s cock would slip lower and run against Tony’s budding cock and he’d shudder a little. He could feel the tingling of arousal growing in his cock but he wasn’t wet and was enjoying the view before him more than anything else.     “Beautiful,” Steve finally said and Tony hadn’t noticed that he was being watched, eyes moving up and away from the cock between his thighs. Tony blushed a little when Steve smiled at him, full and genuine as he continued his slow thrusts.     This was what love was.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*It was just them *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*   Steve held either side of Tony’s head, their foreheads pressed together. Neither dared break eye contact. There was soft grunting and light moans but neither man was being exceptionally noisy or loud in the dark room.     They communicated through their eyes and through their bodies. The arc reactor providing the only light in the room, casting a blue glow across their chests and faces.  It was just them, in this moment,  together.       Tony’s knees where on either side of Steve’s legs, kneeling so that he could move on top of Steve’s dick. Most of the movement was a rotation of his hips and the shallow thrusts up from Steve. It wasn’t the best position for hard and deep thrusts, but neither wanted that tonight. They wanted to  feel  each other. Tony was already bottomed on Steve and his slow gyrating hips proved to be enough.     Steve moved his thumbs across Tony’s cheekbones, savouring the way shadows danced across Tony’s sharp features.     “I love you Steve.” Tony whispered, just loud enough for Steve to understand what had been said.     It was just them and nothing else mattered. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*王嘉尔再次醒来，之前激烈的性爱耗费了他很多体力。 可是一觉睡醒后，他却完全不觉得疲惫，身上也并无酸痛感，甚至感觉比平时还要神清气爽，身体轻盈。 王嘉尔嫌弃地抱着旧床单打算送去洗衣房，刚一起身，就觉得自己的身体十分不对劲。 只要腿部走路的时候一摩擦，自己的两腿之间那个本该什么都没有的地方就传来异样的感觉。 王嘉尔跌回到床上，张开腿，伸手往自己中间的部位摸去，摸到了一个本不应该长在他身上的器官。 “怎么会！”王嘉尔惊恐地收回手，手指间已经沾上了一点透明液体。  一个小时后。 “哈啊。。。该死，根本。。。根本就没办法走路。。。呼。。。” 新多出来的那个性器官实在太敏感，只要双腿稍稍一摩擦，就是从腿间传来又酸又酥麻的感觉，而且王嘉尔的内裤早就湿透了，眼睛也起了一层水雾，全身无力地瘫倒在床上。 棉质的布料已经被浸透了，吸水达到饱和后，还在不断渗出的汁液沿着大腿往裤管里流。 “烦死了！只能这样了。。。” 20分钟后，一个全身上下包得严严实实，戴着口罩的人出现在了楼下便利店，这人走路的姿势十分奇怪，双腿颤抖着，走路的时候把腿分得很开。 “找到了。”王嘉尔迅速拿起货架上一小包粉色的东西，揣到怀里走向收银台。 “一共32元。”服务台的妹妹笑嘻嘻地看着他，把他当成了某个极度害羞又不得不替女朋友买卫生巾的好男友。 王嘉尔付完钱，迅速拿着东西离开了便利店。 真是讨厌死了，为了防止把裤子弄湿，已经事先垫了好几层纸巾，但现在纸巾被完全浸透，还好穿的是黑色裤子湿渍并不明显，王嘉尔边往家赶边想。 “王嘉尔！” 听到自己的名字，王嘉尔条件反射地看向发声的方向，是个不认识的陌生男人。 “真的是你？！我。。。我真的太幸运了！我是你的粉丝，没想到能偶遇到你。”男人激动得有点语无伦次，他跑到王嘉尔身边目光灼灼地看着他。 “呃。。。谢谢。”该死，为什么会在这种时候。。。 “不过你居然能认得出我？”明明他都包得这么严实了。 “那当然了，我可是你的粉丝啊！” “那个。。。虽然见到你很高兴，但我还有事。。。”王嘉尔忍着腿间强烈的不适说道。 “哦，当然，见到你我就很满足了，你去忙吧，再见。” 王嘉尔和他告别后，松了一口气，往家走去。 就算他想尽快到家，但也跑不起来，如果腿间摩擦得稍稍厉害一点的话，恐怕会直接高潮也说不定。 “呼。。。终于到了。。。” 王嘉尔抖着手拿钥匙开门，废了好大劲才把钥匙插入钥匙孔，把门打开。 就在他想进屋的时候，从后面伸出一只手，把他猛地推进去，然后一个人也同时跟了进来，门在身后关上了。 王嘉尔一点力气都没有，直接摔到了地毯上。 “谁？！” 没有人回答，但他被直接翻了过来，他看到了那个人的脸，是刚才自称粉丝的男人。 “在你家楼下蹲了好久了，可算找到机会了。”那人一改之前的单纯老实，表情阴沉地看着他。 “刚才你在便利店的时候我发现你买了女人用的那种东西，是交女朋友了吗？”他说着说着就激动了起来，“你怎么可以交女朋友？！你不是公众人物吗？！” 那人一把把他抱起来，“我倒要看看是什么样的女人。” 小小的单人公寓被翻了个遍。 “奇怪，没有其他女性用品，也没有女人住过的痕迹。。。你买那个干什么？” 王嘉尔紧闭着嘴不肯说话。 “乖，告诉我，是用来做什么？”男人的表情好多了，温柔地把王嘉尔抱在怀里，坐在床上，在他脖子上轻轻吻着。 王嘉尔因为脖子上传来的痒意而瑟缩了一下，他看准时机，一拳打向那人的下巴，趁那人吃痛挣脱开，向门口跑去。 然而刚迈出两步，下面因为被剧烈摩擦而产生的酥麻感让他过电似的软倒在地，下一刻他被人抓起来扔在床上，那个人重重压了上来。 “真是不听话。”男人一边用手抹掉嘴角的血迹一边坏笑着说。 “你到底想干什么？”王嘉尔瞪着身上的人，自从他的身体发生那种奇怪的变化后，力气似乎也变小了，无论怎么挣扎都被压得牢牢的。 “这不是很明显吗？” 那人脱掉他的外套，把手伸进他的衣服下摆，一脸陶醉地说，“就让我做一次，就算让我去死也值了。” “不行，放开我！”王嘉尔害怕了，如果被别人发现他身体的不一样的话，自己就完了。 那人笑着把手伸进王嘉尔的裤子，然后奇怪地看着他，“是湿的？” “不。。。住手啊！” 男人当然不会住手，而是变本加厉地脱掉了他的衣裤，最后撕掉了他的内裤，当把身下的大明星两腿强行打开的时候，他顿住了。 过了一会，他嘴角咧得更大了，缓缓地说，“好像被我发现了不得了的事情呢。” *~*TEXT*~*

His laugh sounded like a rumble as Derek rubbed his face along Stiles’s neck. They grinded against one another, Derek responding to Stiles’s fingers raking up and down his back with stronger thrusts, though they were still clothed. “Such a sexywolf,” Stiles whispered, then pulled up Derek’s shirt as much as he could. Derek tried loosening his pants but breaking contact with Stiles felt impossible. Stiles giggled. All was well. It was perfect. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*  074. Corrupt * Seimei buys Ritsuka a painting set for the holidays. As he expects, Ritsuka's palette smears and smudges with half-dried acrylic paints —  burgundy ,  lotus-pink, navy, turquoise, mint green, goldenrod  flaking against Ritsuka's trousers —  lilac  and  silvery white  streaking down Ritsuka's ring finger as Seimei pretends to nibble on his fingertip —  custard  and  raspberry  and a  deep, vibrant purple,  profound like their bond, like their own tiny world. Like he feels when Ritsuka gazes down at Seimei from underneath his eyelashes, shy and timid, whimpering. Seimei embraces him and pulls Ritsuka's lithe frame over him, running his hands over his naked bottom. He squeezes gently and tests the soft, firm roundness, massaging his thumbs over Ritsuka's cleft and pulling him open. Ritsuka feels most suited for  bubblegum pink  and  thistle  and  kiwi green , innocent and yet remarkably tempting, just as Seimei sees him. *   *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*早知道一进花园就会被人按住在墙角，当初你就打死都不会喝下那杯酒。   说来也奇怪，你一向滴酒不沾，只是碰巧碰到有人在你气头上时给你端了杯酒，那时你的第一个反应不是拒绝，而是回头遥遥看向正在和一个头上插红戴绿的淑女攀谈的李泽言。   用上攀谈这个形容可能词不达意，毕竟怎么看都是那位脑袋上可能端了个鸟窝的小姐在和举着酒杯的李泽言搭话，而他沉默着看向水晶杯里荡漾的酒。   他的眉眼被水晶灯的柔光笼罩住，和昨晚那个按着你在床上、恶劣地逼着你喊自己哥哥的人简直判若两人。   看着被剪裁合身的西服裹着的男人和那位鸟窝小姐交换了一个笑，你扭头就把那酒端过来喝了。    等到你反应过来开始后悔的时候已经迟了。   李泽言的力气不小，轻而易举就箍着你的手将你整个人压在墙上，鼻侧他的呼吸缱绻而暧昧，混着身侧花墙因午夜而更加馥郁的花香味，无时无刻不在提醒着你这个男人在床上的恶劣。   你偏头不去看他，他却捏住你的下颚迫使你转过去，压低的嗓音像是羽毛挠在心头：“我看你胆子还挺大的。”   那杯酒尝到嘴里的时候比水还淡，后劲倒是不小，你整个脑子都是混混沌沌，却还没忘记大着舌头反驳他：“你管得够宽……又不是我亲哥。”   你们兄妹在外和睦亲善兄友妹恭，就差没有传出个你天天给继兄洗脚的美闻，上床的时候，倒是心知肚明了。   你咬了咬唇，还是憋住了那句对于他来讲，你只是可有可无的床伴。   “我不管，”他俯身压过来，温热的舌轻轻舔了一下你的脸颊，你哆嗦了一下，暴露在晚风中的皮肤忍不住随之起了鸡皮疙瘩，他慢条斯理地松了松领带，压根找不到半点和在外那个雷厉风行的李泽言相似之处“等着你那个假惺惺给你端了杯迷药的未婚夫来管吗？”   李泽言定定盯着你，眸里像是翻起了欲要滚涌而来的浪。       ……想要。   你舔了舔唇，才发现已经口干舌燥，那个冠了你未婚夫头衔的男人到底有没有给你端迷药这个问题已经不重要了，你只觉得周身被李泽言的手摸过的地方都像是撩起了火一样，一点点地聚集，再融汇到下身，分泌成花液来倾诉欲望。   你有点庆幸今天穿的是小洋裙，他只需要撩起不算厚的裙摆就可以将欲望嵌入花液泥泞的腿根。那处硕大的头在花缝外摩擦，男人并不急着进入，托着你的臀将你整个人抱起抵在墙上，嚣张跋扈地围着穴口打转，好几次堪堪将顶端挤入，又带着铃口上沾染的花液退出。   好几次喉间的喘息就要溢出。   你攥紧了身下男人的肩膀，手掌磨蹭着他柔软的衬衫面料，隔着衣服摩挲到他贲张而起的肌块。   “哥哥……”你听到自己的声音里带着哭腔，伴随着因为男人的动作而夹杂着的呻吟，就像婴儿一般嗲着嗓子。   他低头擦过你的唇，嘴里呼出的气息与你的混杂在一起，说出的话是恶魔的低语：“告诉我，下次还会不会喝别人递给你的酒。”   自下身传来的欲望让你几欲疯狂，理智一点点地崩离溃散，只会一昧地顺着男人的话说下去：“不会……”   “你是谁的？”带着炙热温度的顶端缓缓推进穴口，你甚至可以感受到顶部的皱褶，一点一点地摩擦过肉缝。   “我是……哥哥的……”   他猛地一推到底。   ……   你大口喘出气，只感觉所谓极乐也不过如此了。还未反应过来，李泽言已经托住你的臀挺腰开始动了起来，身体像是不属于自己一般迎合过去，你扭着腰想要挣脱他，棍身就伴着“噗嗤”的水声一捅到深处。   “嗯……哥哥……”你背后就是带着凉意的墙，身前抵着男人被扯掉几个扣子露出来的结实胸膛，被逼得避无可避。欲望抽插出花穴时带离花液，于是结合处也是汁水淋漓，快意一波波地从你们相连的根部顺着椎骨传上天灵，在他抵住你粗暴地又一次插进时，你的身体抑制不住地痉挛起来，周身都像是过电了一般。   高潮。   销魂蚀骨。   月夜下的青年慢慢扯出一抹笑容，你才注意到他的唇上还带着潋滟水光，一想到这是什么时候沾上的就忍不住脸腾地爆红——    “还没完呢……” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*I asked the incredibly talented @johnlocklover221 how she saw (heard) the Chimera-ish relationship between Sherlock and Moriarty and she gave me the perfect soundtrack, and the perfect words to the tragedy in The Bright Brothers song - “Blood on my Name.” So here is is, a reworking of both tales.  “When the fires, when the fires have surrounded you - And the whole wide world's comin' after you - I've got blood, I've got blood on my name” ~ the brothers bright - blood on my name *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*And the Chimera appeared, with the strength of a lion, the cunning of a goat, and the venom of a snake.  An omen, of the disaster that would befall him. And no twist of plot or manipulation of fate would save him, for the Chimera, the Chimera breathed fire.  Fire to devastate any who would follow and any who would find. And in the pool of darkness, he found her (him).  There were no sacred stars to guide him, and the fires rose under his skin, down to his bone, surrounding him, consuming him.  And the whole wide world came after him, the Hounds of Hell came after him. And then there was nowhere to run.  Cursed.  Finally.  In the grey, on the roof of the world; a lead spear, thrust down her fiery throat. Melting, spreading, burning from the inside out.  Only, the spear. The spear had thrust in his belly too, and it burned unbroken in them both, burned beyond the grave.  The reckoning had come. And there was blood on his name. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*She’s wearing red lipstick today, which he’s never seen her do so  she must have something up her sleeve , Arima reasons.  He’s right. Eto asks him to close his eyes and he can feel her sliding the cold bullet on his lips. The lipstick smells of vanilla.  “I’ve been wondering”, she purrs, “what would it would look like if I let you cover me in kiss marks”. He catches a glimpse of himself on the mirror—she didn’t do a good job of coloring within the lines. Her request seems reasonable enough, though.  He sets fire to her pale skin. *~*TEXT*~*

Not that there's anything wrong with that, we're just not." "That is correct, but I am not sure about the relevance." "I think what Seeley is trying to say is that, being raised in a culture that does not accept such relationships, he has a hard time seeing himself in one." "Thank you, Cam." "That is... understandable. And anyway your ability to support us is a moot point since we both earn much more than you do." "Great, Bones. Way to make a guy feel adequate with his abilities." "Cheer up, Seeley. You have two beautiful women who love you and  want you, I think you are justified in feeling more than adequate."    *~*TEXT*~*

Sara smiled, then leaned down, took a pearl resting on Nyssa's belly into her mouth, then looked Nyssa in the eyes.  "Sweet of you to decorate the place," Sara said, eyebrow raised.

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*不得不说，体力上的压制的确容易给人极大的便利。 有关于谁睡谁这个问题，在胡歌终于从一个又一个让他头昏脑涨的亲吻里回过神来的时候，他已经是衣衫尽退，春光摇曳，面对吴磊攻城略地一般的掌控欲，更是难以自保。 但体内的雄性因子都在叫嚣着不肯后退，两个人差一点在床上打起来。 当然这只是胡歌单方面的认知。 事实上，吴磊太过于轻而易举的钳制住了他并不太安分的身体，随手抽过搭在床头的领带，翻转了身形，绕过手腕简简单单的打了个死结。 “你你你……你先松手……” 胡歌把脸埋在枕头里，满是打不过小孩子的挫败感。 “不用觉得丢脸。”轻轻扳过了他的脸颊，以确保人能够呼吸到新鲜空气。吴磊笑出声：“很多人都打不过我。” “我算是看出来了，小混蛋。”胡歌咬牙切齿：“你从一开始就是有备而来。” “我说了呀，我睡你啊。” 这话说的底气十足，胡歌翻过身看着那人一脸无辜，简直无言以对。 倒也不是不能接受的。 性爱里扮演什么样的角色，大概真的取决于相爱的程度。曾有人愿意为了他而妥协，同样的，他也愿意为了吴磊妥协。 他怕是真的完了。胡歌想，就算这是炮弹，他也舍不得外面那层蜜糖。 耳畔有着细密的喘息声。 一手揽了紧致的腰身，仔仔细细地来回摩挲，触电般，带起一片火星。一手放任修长的手一路向下，挑逗似的，覆上了欲望的中心。 温柔而细致的抚弄。 灼热而潮湿的亲吻落在了他的胸前，粉嫩的乳尖被吴磊含在嘴里，舌尖辗转的舔舐吮吸。 胡歌觉得自己快要被折磨疯了。 “又他妈…没…没有奶……” 吴磊抬头看了他一眼，男人一贯干净清澈的眸子里满是情欲的绯意，湿漉漉的，只诱的人下身硬的发疼。 牙齿不轻不重的咬了一口，本就因为反复研磨已然充血的乳尖愈发红的艳丽。 胡歌瞬间软了腰身。 肌肤胜雪，乳色似血。红白相称，春光更是旖旎。 吴磊心痒难耐，手中动作加了紧，他的手活儿不差，胡歌这会儿又正在他所织就的欲海里浮沉，一会儿工夫便对他缴了械。 润滑剂是一早就准备好的。 毕竟，他是一个合格的猎人。 胡歌看他淡定自若的从衣兜里掏出来，咬着唇恨不得扑上去再跟他干一架。 怒目圆睁的样子真是可爱。吴磊想着便笑起来，用手指去探寻他的后穴。 一根，两根，三根。 “别害怕。” 吻了吻那人带着颤意的蝴蝶骨，吴磊轻声安抚。 在仔仔细细地扩张之后，他终于迫不及待的将自己缓缓送进了那人的体内。 有多疼呢? 胡歌只觉得自己全身都绷紧了，散乱的发丝因为汗水黏在前额，被侵入的压迫感让他难以适应，只得强迫自己放松下来呼气吐气。 吴磊没有动，他忍得很是辛苦，眉头紧皱着。穴口温热而紧致的触感太要命，任谁都很难控制住自己想要驰骋的欲望。 但他毕竟不想伤害胡歌。 一遍又一遍的抚摸过男人的敏感地带，成功把情欲带回人的身体里。 最初的疼痛退去，酥酥麻麻的灼痒在心里叫嚣。 “你…你动吧……” 吴磊开始小幅度的抽动起来，两幅身体迅速地磨合在一起。胡歌适应的很快，他也不再避讳，只狠狠地用了力气，每一下都向着那点敏感的地方撞击。 快感潮水一般将他们包裹。 吴磊不记得自己到底要了胡歌多少次，只记得那双雾气朦胧的眼睛含着祈求望向他，求他快一点，求他停下来，求他再深一点，仿佛只有他能够让他释放，给他快乐，带他翱翔。 他沉溺在那双眼睛里，而这种掌控和占有才真正的让他疯狂。 辨不清来路，亦不知身在何方。 耳鬓厮磨，缠绵入骨。月圆花好，亦不过尘世痴情人。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Since Hannibal vanished Will has lost his ability to see color. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Will Graham doesn’t see color anymore. It baffles everyone, that he could survive such a fall and yet lose this ability most take for granted.  Will doesn’t know, but tells charred Chilton and lovely Alana that the color drained from his world with Hannibal’s death.  Chilton laughs bitterly and Alana sighs.     *  Will sees everything in black and white, even his dogs.  He never cared for fashion anyway, so who cares if his clothes don’t match. His inner Hannibal voice winces.  He drinks some more whisky and the rain is a grayish sluice that lasts for days.  “Slainte,” he says to no one but himself.     *  He fucks a man to see if anything changes. It doesn’t. The man tells him he’s crazy and leaves. Will already knew that.     *  When he comes home one day his yard is full of roses. They are brilliant red, even if everything else is still monochrome. “Hannibal,” Will says and he’s here, also in color even if nothing else is.  “Come with me,” Hannibal says and the rain parts to let them pass.  “Why not?” Will asks and all his dogs follow as they kiss. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*张新杰从周泽楷手里接过优盘，旁若无人地在叶修的电脑桌前坐下，把优盘插进了电脑。  文件夹才刚刚打开，叶修就意识到了那是什么，他一边在心里痛骂喻文州和王杰希，一边不断后退。  身前的方锐已经越逼越近，直到把叶修逼到了床边，再也无处可退。  方锐笑眯眯地搂住了叶修的肩膀，强迫叶修坐了下来：“老叶啊，太不厚道了吧。录那种视频都不告诉我一声，老队友怎么着也能给你打打下手吧。”  叶修握着方锐的手想往下扯，却被方锐反抓着腕子摁在了床上。  “别闹，我和文州、杰希在谈恋爱呢，录点小视频助助兴也没什么吧。”叶修面不改色地说着违心的话，“现在可是开放社会。”  “骗人。”周泽楷绕到叶修的另一边圈住了叶修的腰：“那黄少天和张佳乐呢？”  叶修呼吸一窒，周泽楷怎么连这都知道。  周泽楷把下巴搭在了叶修的肩上，贴着叶修耳朵吐出的话语饱含控诉：“你不是在和他们谈恋爱吗？”  黄少天和张佳乐并没有和谁说过他们和叶修在一起了，周泽楷的这句话纯属推测，但看到叶修难堪的表情，他就知道自己猜对了。  周泽楷拿到孙翔给他的视频后把整件事情猜了个八九不离十，估计是喻文州和王杰希给叶修录了视频结果阴沟里翻船，被黄少天和张佳乐截了胡。  孙翔和唐昊一听，第一个反应是：这居然不是全员福利，第二个反应是：叶修居然谈恋爱了，第三个反应是：我日。  坐在电脑前的张新杰已经把视频点进了播放，他站起身走到床边抬起了叶修的下巴：“怎么能说是助兴视频呢？这明明就是教学视频，是领队给我们这些单身队员的性爱教学视频。”  张新杰不顾叶修的推拒，把食指和中指塞进了叶修的嘴里，夹住柔软的舌头粗暴地摁压了起来：“现在我们想申请一次现场教学，不知道领队同不同意？”  叶修瞪大了眼睛，拼命地摇头，挣扎着就要从床上站起来，但是方锐和周泽楷一左一右把他的手臂抱得死死的。  孙翔和唐昊也凑了上来：“我也要现场教学！领队不能偏心，只顾着给个别人开小灶！”  张新杰的手指堵着叶修的嘴，让叶修吐不出一个拒绝的字眼。  五个人压制着叶修，轻而易举地就把叶修的睡衣剥了个一干二净。  刚刚张新杰从电脑桌前离开时，故意把屏幕转向了正对着床的方向，现在叶修被摁在床头，一抬眼看到的就是视频里自己被喻文州和王杰希打开大腿的画面。  视频里的那个自己，正眼含春色敞开着大腿，隐约能看见两腿间一片水色，绯色的穴口蠕动着，要多淫荡有多淫荡。  叶修别开眼睛，不忍直视视频里的自己。  张新杰掰过叶修的头，强迫他去看正在播放中的视频：“看啊，领队你在视频里表现的多么游刃有余啊，想必一会在指导我们的时候也能轻松自如吧。”  周泽楷学着视频里喻文州的样子把叶修的双手用腰带捆在了头顶，张新杰紧随其后开拓起了叶修的甬道。  两个人的一举一动和视频里的喻文州、王杰希仿佛一个模子刻出来的，当真是把这样一个色情至极的黄片当成了一个教学视频。  只可惜他们来的匆忙，既没有带润滑剂，也没有带分腿器。不过叶修根本不需要额外的润滑剂，后穴就已经湿得一塌糊涂。  被喻文州和王杰希充分开发过的身体，在五个人的同时撩拨下，情欲很快升腾而起，席卷了叶修全身，后穴忍不住收缩着主动吃起了张新杰的手指。  虽然这里没有视频里花样繁多的道具，却有着实打实的五根肉棒等着叶修。  没有口球，周泽楷干脆用嘴封住了叶修的唇，卷起了叶修的舌头，一路攻城掠地。  没有乳夹，孙翔和唐昊叼着叶修的乳尖玩得不亦悦乎。  余下方锐和张新杰，一个抚慰叶修的欲望却掐着铃口不让叶修释放，一个以打桩机的姿态每一下都迅速而猛烈地撞击上叶修的前列腺。  叶修被五个人团团围住，无尽的情潮涌上他的神经中枢，带着他的意识不断下沉，除了身体上传来的快感，什么都感知不到。  等到张新杰和周泽楷在叶修体内射完精，叶修勉强提起些力气恳求地看向围住自己的五个人：“求求你们……呼……让我休息——唔！”  回应叶修的是突然插进他嘴里的一根大肉棒。  孙翔抓着叶修的头发，感受到柱身被温热的口腔紧紧地包裹住，舒服得他几乎要喟叹出声。  比起舒服了的孙翔，叶修的喉咙被圆润的龟头用力抵住，浓烈的男性气息萦绕在他的鼻尖，让他几欲作呕。  因为难受而滚动的给了孙翔更大的刺激，他迫不及待地在叶修的嘴里抽插了起来：“休息？后面还有三个人呢，你休息了我们怎么办？”  叶修还没来得及抗拒嘴里的凶器，空下来的后穴又被炙热的一大根堵住了入口，熟悉的酸胀感紧随其后。  唐昊已经一鼓作气冲进了叶修体内的最深处，抱着叶修的大腿毫无章法地操干。  肉体撞击的声音在领队的房间里又响了起来。  唐昊只顾着自己怎么爽怎么来，疼得叶修眼角通红，可怜兮兮地挂着一滴泪。直到结合处挤压出的白沫里带上了点点血丝，唐昊才后知后觉地收了些力道。  被迫承受着的叶修怎么也想不明白，不过是被喻文州和王杰希录了一个视频，怎么就到了这步田地。  喻文州和王杰希也想不明白。  他俩正拉着黄少天和张佳乐竞技场决斗。  四个在荣耀里杀得双眼通红的前男友和现男友们根本没有想到，叶修正被他们的另外五个队友摁在床上从头到脚玩了个通透。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Small Watcher/Tekēhu prompt from my Tumblr. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Tekēhu kept shifting and moving slightly, almost like he was uncomfortable. He pulled his hands slighty, testing the give of the sash holding them to the bedpost. The Watcher was sitting on top of him in nothing but their undergarments with their hands and lips all over Tekēhu’s skin, teasing and caressing. Almost like worship in how gentle and kind they were being, but worship in a good way, in a way he actually enjoyed.  They stopped the moment they felt Tekēhu move again, sitting up.  “We can stop you know, if you don’t wish to continue.”  There was a little concern in their voice, and when Tekēhu looked up at them, it was also in their eyes.  “It’s not that I wish you for you to stop,” he shifted his hips up to rub against the Watcher, “it’s just that I wish for you to move faster.”  The Watcher bends down closer and grins at him.  “You know, I was hoping to take my time with you, but we can always do that some other day, yeah?”  Tekēhu nods wordlessly, licking his lips in anticipation as the Watcher takes off the last of their clothes. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“台风要来了。” 陈立农在他耳后说出这句话，嘴唇若即若离地擦着林彦俊的耳廓。温热的呼吸让本就通红的耳垂变得更加敏感，林彦俊的牙齿死死扣住下唇，他光滑的背部紧贴着陈立农的胸口，在感受着有力心跳的同时被汗水打湿——都是陈立农的汗水。这个小他五岁的家伙新陈代谢好得出奇，仿佛动动手指就要出汗，更遑论这种时刻。而林彦俊则像个不带汗腺出生的人，即使是现在，他憋得眼角泛红，身体本身依旧是干爽温软的。 他从来很满意这一点，尽管长辈说不排汗容易中暑，但他认为总好过在高温的夏季满身粘腻和异味。他也一向不喜在夏季与人靠近，人体的湿热气息令他不由自主地反感。 可陈立农是个例外。大汗淋漓的他像一株雨后拔高的小树，笔直地站在那里拨开打湿的刘海冲人笑起来，皮肤源源不断地淌着水，留下的却是清冽湿润的少年味道。 这大概就是为什么他能允许陈立农的汗水包裹着他的原因，整个房间里充斥着暧昧的荷尔蒙气味，穿透这一切抵达他鼻尖的却还是那股专属于陈立农的清冽气息。 陈立农说完那句话就离开了他的耳朵，嘴唇下移至蝴蝶骨，亲了亲，然后果断地直起手臂撑起身体用更猛烈的力道冲撞林彦俊的身体。他身下的人被顶得咬不住嘴唇，几乎喘得上气不接下气了，陈立农自己倒是咬紧了牙，眼神带着毫不掩饰的侵略意味游走在林彦俊纤细得令人喉咙发紧的腰肢上，这把细腰正随着他的动作起起伏伏，像台风天出海的小船一样毫无招架之力，只能任由另一股庞大的力量左右摆弄。 他腰部脆弱白皙的皮肤还残留着之前陈立农留下的齿痕和指印，陈立农早就发现这个位置很讨巧，他们的工作性质不允许他在锁骨、颈部、手臂等位置留下痕迹，腰部则相对安全，而且一旦在腰部留有印记的情况下上舞台，林彦俊都会百般小心不让衣服下摆掀起，不给任何镜头窥见他腰部的机会。 陈立农曾经看过不少精妙绝伦的抓拍，镜头将林彦俊的腰肢定格在最清晰又最诱惑的一刻，他忍不住点开图反复打量，却又深深不满这绝好风光有成千上万人共享。而在他着意留下些许印记之后，这类照片就在林彦俊的严防下几乎绝迹了。 不过林彦俊不知道他的小心思，顶多以为这是他情难自禁时的偏好罢了，他们的性事总是激烈而直白的，像所有不带感情只为发泄欲望的伴侣一样。而作为96频道的好友，他们身体的契合度也是满点，从未有一次不尽兴，从未有一次不令人感到几乎要溺毙其中。 但林彦俊其实为这契合度感到恐慌过，太合拍了，太配合了，他有些难以分辨这到底是因为两人真的天生默契惊人还是因为——他确实，确实爱着陈立农，在过去和现在，都比他在床上表现出的还要多的，爱着陈立农。 当陈立农终于射在他身体里的时候，林彦俊又感觉到一串汗珠滴落在他的背上，顺着骨骼悄然滑落。他从过于强烈的快感中渐渐回过神来，意识到陈立农正在离开他的身体，有液体从后部缓慢流出，他能闻到的清冽气息逐渐被精液的味道取代。 陈立农翻身下床，快速套上一条家居裤，然后过来拍了拍林彦俊的手臂： “去洗澡啦。”   林彦俊终于洗完澡出来的时候，陈立农脖子上挂着一条厚厚软软的白毛巾正在煮牛奶，半干的刘海软趴趴地垂在前额，显得整个人乖巧又温和。听到林彦俊出来的动静，他关了火端起奶锅慢慢往两个玻璃杯里倒。 林彦俊接过他递来的牛奶，从陈立农高层公寓的落地窗窗帘缝隙中往外看。雨倒是不大不小，但拍打在玻璃窗上的风声已经令人心惊了。 是台风天。 他想起自己停在楼下车库里那辆专程开来的低调三菱就觉得头疼，这种天开车上路显然不是什么好主意，但是时间已经接近午夜，即使明天他和陈立农都没有上午的行程，他也不好再拖延了。 自从他们变成这种关系之后，林彦俊从未留宿。 巧的是陈立农也从未在他干脆离开的时候挽留过。 他们都很明白自己端的是个什么饭碗，出道本就不是容易的事，对他们两人来说好像尤其的不容易些。刚出道时每天的生活都崭新得令人心惊，他们在新的世界面前几乎要看花了眼，回头一看，只有彼此的灵魂还是最熟悉的。但此前那种纯粹的黏连不分的相处方式已经不合时宜了，他们的眼睛要装下成千上万人，要装得满漫天的斑斓灯海，要盛得住山呼海啸的爱意和希望。人说神造人，可神皆为人所造。他们是新的神，神像由千千万万人一刀一斧凿刻而来，他们在云端挥一挥手便能让人感到天降甘霖。但也因此，他们可以谁也不爱，可以爱千千万万人，唯独不能只爱一个人。 所以只能是这样的关系，他们做不到舍弃对方，就只有这样，简单直白，不会粘腻不清难分难舍，又足够贴近，近得骨肉相融。 第一次上床是在最后一场巡演结束之后，每个人卸妆都卸得筋疲力尽却又意犹未尽。舞台会让任何人的血液沸腾起来，血管里的喧嚣经久不息，更不用说这场巡演的终结为它染上了点惜别的意味，在那种时刻林彦俊看向陈立农，对方的眼神依旧诚挚，接着热度渐渐上升，96频道的电流全部化为火花。 从那以后他们只在两个地方燃烧自己，一个是舞台，一个是彼此的床上。   林彦俊开着静音的手机亮起屏幕，是台风的警戒讯。雨声依旧是忽大忽小，只有狂风始终躁动不安。在这样的高层望出去会恍惚以为身处台风中心的孤岛，于是林彦俊想起很久远的时候陈立农对着镜头说，在孤岛，要生存的话肯定要带林彦俊啊。那时候陈立农的瓜皮头还没怎么做过造型，说这话时眼睛亮晶晶。现在已经没人问他们这种问题了，就算问了他猜陈立农也不会回答林彦俊，就像他不会回答陈立农一样。 但是，在这个不知名的台风夜里，与那些真真假假的你问我答毫无关系地，陈立农站在他身后抽走他喝完的温热牛奶杯，用他在廊坊最后的两人时光里听过无数次的低声说道：就留下来好了，阿俊。 断断续续的风声已经变成连绵不绝的呼啸，林彦俊恍惚以为强风要将地壳都撼动，此刻没有人记得他是谁，包括他自己。 于是他点了点头，又怕陈立农没看到似的，补了一句“嗯”。 陈立农还是站在他身后，两只手都握着玻璃杯，于是他轻声叹了口气，向前一步，低头亲吻了林彦俊。   Fin *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*后来证明那是一个春梦。  轰焦冻梦到他和绿谷出久回到了城堡。门厅内高朋满座，衣香鬓影间，舞会即将拉开帷幕，但王子却不见踪影。  楼上的某一间客房内，轰焦冻从正面紧紧地拥抱住绿谷出久，他们光裸的上身紧贴着，炽热的汗液将彼此都弄得潮湿黏腻，绿谷出久的一声声沉重的喘息对于他而言都是最佳的催情药物。他嗅着少年发间的浅香，和缓而深重地抽插着。频率不高，但每一次都挤开紧致的后穴，撞进最深的地方。  “哈……哈啊……”绿谷出久将因情欲而涨红了的脸埋进轰焦冻的肩窝，满满当当的填入和有力的插入让他忍不住抓紧轰焦冻的头发，“殿下……他们都、都在找你……”  轰焦冻的心头闪过一丝不悦，虽然沉静的脸上没有表现出来，但是下身却本能地加重了动作。他蹭着绿谷出久的敏感带，发狠地研磨过去，绿谷出久的眼睛一下子湿润了，他窒息般不断抽着气：  “轻一点……呜啊！”  最后那声“啊”明显音调走得有些高，绿谷出久立刻紧紧捂住自己的嘴，他感受到体内的性器又胀大了一圈，身体就好像要被轰焦冻的体温融化。  走廊外传来仆人慌张的脚步声，下人们正忙上忙下地寻找轰王子的下落。  但是在宾客面前衣冠楚楚、严肃正经的轰焦冻，此刻正在压在绿谷出久年轻饱满的身体上，他粗壮的阴茎正在淫水四溅的穴道中抽动。轰焦冻低吟一声，他结实的双臂牢实地撑在被汗水浸湿的床单上，垂眸看着绿谷出久因为情潮涌动而不知所措的脸。  “怎么了，绿谷。”他压低嗓音问，放缓了插动的频率，低头舔吻着绿谷出久滚烫的脸，“你在担心什么？”  “……门、门……”绿谷出久不敢说太长的句子，他怕他一张口就是害臊的叫床声。  轰焦冻微愣，像是被逗乐了似的，他蹭了蹭绿谷的额头。     “你好可爱。”     紧接着，他突然剧烈地撞击起来。  绿谷出久被突如其来的动静操得甚至有些不清醒，他甚至完全不能控制自己的嗓音，狠抓着身上人的后背激烈地叫了两声。恍惚间，楼下大厅悠扬的乐声朦朦胧胧地飘入他的耳朵，他这才明白他刚刚做了什么。  轰焦冻似乎完全已经忘记了自己所在的地点和拥有的身份，或者他从一开始就不在意这些。他架起绿谷出久的双腿，大汗淋漓地朝着一点用力操着。绿谷出久瘫软在床垫上，自暴自弃地胡乱扭动着，迎合着轰焦冻的撞击。  为了避免发出不堪入耳的淫声，他只好咬着自己的手，可惜迭起的欲潮让他总是不受控制地迷恋般注视着轰焦冻的眼睛，忍不住松开牙关向对方索吻。  轰焦冻伸出舌头，顺着绿谷出久下颚上晶莹的唾液丝线舔上去。他看绿谷出久忍得痛苦，哄骗他：“别咬这个，咬我吧。”  他掰开绿谷出久的嘴，将舌头伸进去。下身激烈的装懂刺激得彼此唇舌的热吻也变得激烈而强硬，绿谷出久紧紧地攀住轰焦冻的后颈，整个人贴了上去，在情欲浓靡的交合中越缠越紧。  突然地，门外传来一阵清晰的对话。     “还有哪里没找？”  “是这间吗？”     绿谷出久猛地瞪大眼睛，生理泪水不自觉地从眼眶流下，他推着轰焦冻的肩膀，低喘着抗拒着：  “殿下……啊哈……他们快要……”  像是为了惩罚他的不专心，轰焦冻猛地重重地撞了一下。  “不、不行……”  钥匙插进锁眼的声音让绿谷出久紧张得头皮发麻，他的后穴绞得紧紧的，吸得轰焦冻差一点就射了出来。请求的声音带上了哭腔：“不能……这样……不能被看到……”  他这样淫乱而不知羞耻、满身吻痕和精斑的样子，不能被看见。  绿谷出久绝望地闭上眼睛，他感觉到轰焦冻根本没有停下来的意思，反而一次比一次深，一次比一次重，烙铁般的性器让他浑身战栗不断，他不受控制地想象着待会儿仆人们推门进来的样子，说不定还有轰焦冻的其他兄弟姐妹，甚至国王和皇后……  门把被扭转了，绿谷出久感觉自己已经濒临窒息，他双眼失神地望着绣纹精美的帐顶，感受着男人的性器在逼仄的穴道猛地顶弄了两下，随后射出一股股精液……     “好像不是这把。”  “钥匙全部试过了吗？”  “全部试过了。”     脚步声渐渐远去。绿谷出久如得救的溺亡者大声喘息起来，他睁开泪眼朦胧的眼睛，望着轰焦冻近在咫尺的脸，发出惊魂未定般抽泣似的的呻吟。  轰焦冻缓慢地将自己软掉的阴茎抽出绿谷出久的体外，多出来的精液从穴口溢了出来，流过绿谷出久满是指印和吻痕的大腿根。轰焦冻从枕头下摸出一把黄铜钥匙，他轻轻把它放在绿谷出久的胸膛上。冰冷的金属质地与染着粉色的皮肤形成强烈的反差，看上去格外的色情和淫乱。  他低下头，重新顺着绿谷出久肌肉的轮廓咬吻舔舐，一直来到对方的脖颈，顺着怕痒的敏感地带一路吻上去，低声对对方红得滴血的耳朵说：     “我允许你相信我。”     轰焦冻睁开眼睛。他首先感受到的是旅馆小房间不同寻常的燥热，应该是夜晚太闷，又没开窗，所以连气流的流通速度都相当迟缓。  他浑身都是热汗，衬衣衬裤早被汗得透湿，爬起来坐了一会儿，才意识到双腿间反常的潮湿。  头好痛。轰焦冻捏了捏鼻梁，梦里的场景就像一只虚幻的手，在他的眼皮前晃来晃去。  他转脸看了一眼隔壁床的绿谷出久，对方背对着他睡得很沉。皎洁的月光穿窗而过，照亮了他毛茸茸的头发。     暂时……不能让他知道这件事。     轰焦冻轻手轻脚地爬起来，去了卫生间。     确认浴室传来了流水声，绿谷出久才敢睁开眼睛。  在轰焦冻看不到的地方，绿谷出久满脸潮红，就像刚刚发了一场高烧。性器微微发硬，摩擦着他的大腿，让他忍不住脊背蜷缩起来。他想起刚刚做的那个梦，性交的感觉实在太过真实，他甚至现在还记得被男根插到射出来的那种强烈的刺激。  绿谷出久偷偷摸摸地将手伸进裤子里，睫毛不安地颤动，低声地喘息着。     绝对，不能让殿下知道这件事。        那是他们共同做过的一个春梦。     THE END *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*【全职/王喻/BDSM】色戒-1  bdsm向。有sp内容。  只是好奇的话，请别点进来看，免得毁三观。  没有什么剧情，不适请及时退出谢谢。  或许有后续。     “久等了。”  王杰希推开门，语气带着点能冻到人骨子里去的凉意。  任哪一个S发现M比自己到的还早，怕是都会憋闷得很。何况这个M在之前的线上交流说自己是第一次——第一次就意味着更耐心的引导，更细致的观察，更全面的掌控，恐怕还需要反复教导规则。王杰希在这个圈子里成名已久，若不是这人找了“色戒”的老板一定要约他一次，他还真没兴趣来玩这一趟。  色戒是帝都圈子里最有名的一家，以安全的隐私保护和多样的工具和玩法而出名。这个房间王杰希来过很多遍了，他迈着步子走进来关上门，细致地从里面上好锁。转过进门的一道磨砂玻璃隔断，他扫视着迎面显眼的铁架，思量着取哪一样工具给第一次实践的M热身。  跪在长凳边上纤瘦挺拔的背影转过来。朝他露出一个很熟悉的微笑。   “晚上好，王队。”     “……喻队？”  这还是王杰希第一次约到熟人。他今天戴了一副平光的金丝眼镜，目光就从镜片里向下露出些惊异的光来。SM本就是你情我愿愉悦彼此的过程，谁也不愿在事后再有什么乱七八糟的瓜葛，当然，玩舒服了再约一次的就另当别论。帝都这个圈子说大不大说小也不小，王杰希是混圈三年的纯S，早就是不折不扣的前辈，圈里也多半都是他认识的，故而王杰希真没考虑过约到熟人的可能性。之前有一次约到了他的粉丝，那个M当场就激动的浑身发抖，几乎就拽着鞭子求着他打了——因此之后他再接受别人的预约，都吩咐老板事先调查好。这下倒好了，没有微草的粉，倒约来了蓝雨队长。  不过，喻文州……似乎也没那么糟糕。  “早知道是我？”王杰希很快收起了讶异，露出个有些玩味的笑来，“第一次？”  他漫不经心地往前走了两步，皮鞋刚好踩在喻文州手边，在有些昏暗不清的灯下幽幽泛着光。  “嗯，第一次。”喻文州坦荡地答。他穿了套很简单的白衬衫黑裤子，发梢还带着些水汽，更像个纯洁青涩的大学生。他在四角坠着镣铐的长凳边上跪着弯下腰去，一个吻落在王杰希的皮鞋上，“王队可以……随时可以开始。”  这是都准备好了的意思。  “不急。”王杰希对喻文州这样与其说撩拨不如说挑衅的动作不置可否，只是半眯着眼欣赏着他弯曲的脊骨，像是要用目光在他背上打下烙印。  “第一次就约我，不怕留下什么心理阴影？”  “因为知道是王队，才敢约一次的。”喻文州直起腰来，微微垂着头，摆出个很谦卑的姿势来，嘴唇慢慢吐出个词来，“Hunter”。  这是王杰希在圈子里的代号。  “好。”  王杰希利落地脱下黑色西服外套挂在架子上，转身摘了条容易上手也不会太疼的散鞭，在空气中简单挥了几下。  “除了不能碰手，还有别的禁忌或者需求吗？”  “没有。”  “这么相信我？”王杰希换了一只手挥着散鞭，“那说个安全词吧。不然就索克萨尔？”  “王不留行吧。”喻文州忍不住笑了一笑。他笑着本就好看，配着现下这个背景这身衣服更是十分的赏心悦目。王杰希挑了挑眉，鞭梢破空而下，不轻不重落在喻文州肩上。  “开始了。站起来，把衣服脱了。”  TBC *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*26 体育馆完全安静下来，他们躲在无人的阶梯座椅背后。 叶修扒掉喻文州的西服，从他衬衫下摆伸进去，退役这几年时光的流逝好像也少有痕迹，他肌肉纹理依然恰到好处，从腰后到蝴蝶骨延展出一段曲线，背脊凹下去，他攀着叶修的肩，扬起头，衬衫被褪到手腕。 叶修入目是他白皙的胸口，微微鼓起，往下隐隐能看出肌肉轮廓，但是不显，两条人鱼线把腰收紧，胯下已经隆起一块，叶修轻笑了声：“光摸你后背就硬了？太放浪了文州，我要是摸你屁股你不是要直接高潮？” 他恶劣地拉着喻文州胸口两点往外扯，听到喻文州呜地一声，叶修用拇指揉搓起来。 喻文州下巴抵在叶修头顶，叶修把他乳首搓红含进嘴里的时候他整个人都颤抖着往前倾，把叶修的头往自己身体里压，屁股翘得很高，西裤下滑带着内裤，露出一截股沟，泛着水光。 叶修吸完抬起头来问：“怎么不出货？那你怎么奶孩子。”喻文州头埋下去，听叶修乱说话，正值敏感，耳廓都红了一圈，平常他也就怼回去了，现下得了爽利，话也说不出。 叶修舔够了，拉开他，捏着喻文州的下巴：“乖，回去做。” 喻文州笑了一下，搭在他颈窝上表示拒绝：“就在这儿。” 叶修看着他，喻文州能忍让是能忍让，倔起来也是真的倔，他要控场的时候能跟你打得有来有回，软下来又能抱着你撒娇。上次想吃车厘子，钻叶修怀里喊爸爸，又蹭又舔。叶修说他至于吗，好歹也是蓝雨的队长，为了吃个车厘子，什么都做得出来，喻文州得逞地笑着看他。 他此时低下头趴在叶修双腿之间，被他又硬又粗的肉棒塞满嘴巴，眼睛含水往上望着很是可怜，他舌头伸出来从茎体舔到马眼，叶修按着他的头慢慢往里面进去，在他舌头上摩擦，插到最里面的时候，喻文州鼻子挨着他胯下的毛发，口水滴上去，湿漉漉的，他往后退了一点，喻文州吞咽口水，吸了一下。 叶修嘶了一声，掌着他的头舒服得不想动。喻文州撑着他的双腿，舔舐吸弄，屁股露出半截，圆润白皙，在黑暗里亮了一个轮廓。 叶修伸手打了他屁股一巴掌，让他翘高一点，方便他手指进去搅弄，喻文州呜呜两声，肉棒插到他喉咙深处，眼泪都流下来。 “舒服吗？”叶修问他，只能换来两句模糊不清的呻吟。 他突然扶着喻文州的脑后迅速地抽插起来，喻文州的大腿绷紧颤抖，低声啜泣，眼泪混着汗水滴在叶修胯下，在他射出来的瞬间支撑不住歪倒在他身上。 叶修单手抬起他的下巴，喻文州嘴角沾了点白色的精液，剩下的部分被他全部吞了下去，双眼迷离湿漉漉的，鼻尖泛红，口水从嘴角流出来。 叶修俯下身吻他，舔干净他嘴角的口水，帮他穿好衣服站起来。 “太晚了，先去我那儿对付一晚。” *~*TEXT*~*

He's numb, numb to the rest of it, except for the bonfire growing by the second. Thor takes him, holds him, fills him in ways that set off fireworks. His tongue is wet with heat, biting and nipping, teasing the flames.  There is no tender way to put a fire out. It is doused entirely by a wave that makes Bruce tremble. He rides the wave out, dragging Thor with him as the fire dies. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*似乎有热水在激烈的冲撞中被小白起带进了花穴，在紧致湿软的花穴里激荡，变的更加温暖柔软，又在退出时带着蜜液一起融进水中。 强烈的快感令姜君有些失神，颤抖着绷紧了腰腹，双腿夹紧想紧贴在他身上。夹的白起忍不住一阵猛冲。 “啊……白起……白起……”水中的身体随着白起突然剧烈起来的律动而摇摆，明亮的灯光有些晃眼，她闭上眼不住低吟白起的名字，轻柔颤抖的气声带着低沉的喉音，在哗啦啦的水声中分外诱人。 感受到滚烫的欲望在她身体里脉动，似乎胀的更大、更紧了，满满的没有一丝缝隙。 幸福满足的感觉流淌全身。 “很好听……我喜欢听你的声音……”白起半眯起漂亮的眼睛喘息着舔上她的耳垂，在她耳边低声说。 “喜欢你喊我名字……”他轻抚姜君敏感的腰侧，匀速的抽插中突然又重重的顶了一下，引的她又呻吟出声全身剧烈抖了一下，花穴也猛的一紧。 “呃……”白起闷哼一声，喘息间颤抖的声音越发性感撩人，“姜君……我的爱人……我想听一辈子……”他配合着舔吮的动作稍稍放慢速度，合着水声来来回回不知疲倦的抽送着。 即使命运令我失去一切，也不能把你从我心中剥夺。 不知是浴室里带着白起气息的湿热微风，还是他在耳际的舔舐，或是他炽热的胸膛和猛烈的心跳，亦或是他一呼一吸间诱人的声音和喷吐在耳朵上的气息，姜君头脑发晕。 酥麻的感觉和他一下一下闯进自己身体的感觉混在一起，从头皮发麻蔓延到全身。 潮水般的快感不断扩散开来，层层堆叠，从不回落，越堆越高，像是要把她一步步推向高高的云端。 “白起……啊……我答应你……”急促的喘息令她的话断断续续。 姜君眼里水光潋滟，她仰起头露出修长脖颈，乳峰随急促的喘息剧烈起伏，温软的触碰摩擦着白起的胸膛，两点嫣红凸起分外硬挺醒目。 急促有力的心跳如同美妙的和弦， 透过肌肉骨骼皮肤直接传达给对方。无需言语，便宛如清晰的说着最美的情话，“我灵魂所描绘的爱情，只在你的心头”。 她全身酸软，不再支撑身体，而是完全把自己交给了白起，只尽力搂住他此刻肌肉凸显的脊背，承受他仿佛永无止境的滚烫爱意。 白起的欲望反复刮过花穴中层层叠叠的柔软峰峦，不时重重撞进花心，或故意研磨一块她最敏感的软肉，引的她连连摇头，在水中颤抖不已。 他把姜君的双腿打开贴在腰间炽热的皮肤上，让自己的欲望进的更深，在她的低吟声和肆意喧闹的水声中，一次次不知餍足的用力贯穿她的身体。 “哈……我再也不会离开你……”极致的欢愉中，她低声私语，如同只说与风知道的秘密。 白起，你是我的辰星，清辉永驻，即使我跋涉于凛冽寒夜，也不再孤独不再迷失方向。 “唔……”她忽然绷紧了全身的肌肉，花穴被白起硬挺粗大的欲望撑的发麻，干的发烫，在水流的冲刷和白起的冲撞中颤抖着有力的抽搐收缩，已然承受不住抵达了高潮，可她的喘息和呻吟都被白起霸道的深吻堵了回去，身下更是狠狠的抽插不停。 他还想要更多！ 姜君的嘴唇乃至全身都在明显的颤抖着，花穴更加紧密的缩紧，湿滑密实的包裹住他的欲望，抽插变得更艰难也更火热，舒服至极。 我也再也不会离开你…… 唇舌间忘我的翻搅纠缠，无法回落的快感推着他们如同升腾的云烟，继续往高处探寻。 不够……还不够！ 她口中残留的淡淡酒气刺激的白起越发用力起来，粗长的欲望每每全根没入，都引的她颤抖着扭动身体，更加缩紧花穴似乎不舍他离开。如果不是他的手臂揽着，他的冲撞几乎要把已经背贴浴池的姜君撞出去。 即使背对灯光，他微微眯起的眼中光彩，仍然比阳光更热烈、也更耀眼。带着一往无前的气势和野心，也带着满腔眷恋柔情，骄傲宣告此时是他占有了姜君的全部身心。 白起的挺进越来越快也越来越重，水波在周身激荡，她几乎在白起身下化成了水，不时绷紧全身止不住颤抖，花穴收缩不停，滚烫的蜜液喷涌，却只能迎来更强烈的刺激。 “呜……”她不住的吸气，口中却无法发出抗议的声音。 几乎无法承受的欢愉一波一波汹涌袭来，此时无论白起任何的抚摸触碰，都会让她已极度敏感的身体获得超出极限的快感。 但她不知道自己的身体仍无意识的努力迎合着白起的抽送，只想获得更多。 酥麻的感觉迟迟不退，如果白起没有在她口中肆虐，她大概已经忍不住叫出声来。 不知过了多久，白起终于稍稍满足，闷哼一声抵在最深处释放出滚烫的精液。姜君已颤抖着软在白起怀中，眼神迷离只剩喘息的力气。 白起温柔的吻掉她嘴角不知是汗水还是泪水的痕迹，搂着她利落的一个翻身让她趴在自己身上。 他弹性十足的炽热胸膛还在呼吸中明显的起伏，胸口仿佛趴了一只乖顺的猫咪，一脸疲倦而满足的神情，任摸任抱。 浴池里的水已泼洒出去大半，白起打开水龙头重新放进热水，轻柔的抚摸着姜君的后背，每一处淡淡的疤痕都令他心疼不已。 “吃晚饭了吗？”姜君的声音依然带着情色的勾人慵懒，她习惯性的在他胸口蹭了蹭，找了个舒服的姿势。 “咳……不是刚吃完吗？”白起轻笑出声。 “咬你哦！”姜君说着真咬了他一口。 “嘶……我忽然觉得，再吃一次也不错。”他的手不安分的向下滑去，看姜君一脸无奈的盯着他的可爱表情，不由低低的笑起来，“忙完我就赶回来了，倒是你怎么还没吃晚饭？” “我！不！饿！哎呀你又戳我脸……”姜君说着不甘示弱抬手就去捏白起的脸。 二人终于笑闹着洗完这个时间格外漫长的热水澡。 这个生日或许被工作占去了太多时间，但今夜的开头依然十分美好。 *~*TEXT*~*

"And lastly, you call me 'baby' when you want to fuck me!" "That's right, baby!" "Hmm. So now, what do you call me?" "That depends. Do you want 'honey' or 'baby'?" "Oh! Come here, baby! Fuck me!" *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*MC was currently in detention for running in the halls. Baldi was catching up and entered the room. MC whimpered and just as he was about to he get spanked by Baldi, Baldi shrunk down to the size of an ant. MC was shocked at first, but a few seconds later that shock turned into sadism. Baldi gulped and, before he could run, MC stepped on him. MC grinded his shoe into the floor as Baldi screamed in pain. MC then took his shoe off of Baldi and stepped on him with his smelly foot as Baldi gagged. He put more pressure on Baldi, causing his legs to break and bleed out and Baldi’s cries of pain were smothered by his giant foot. He took his foot off of Baldi and cummed.     He then sat on Baldi. He clenched his cheeks, putting Baldi in great pain. He began farting on him non-stop. Baldi couldn’t breathe. He suffocated to death. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*She reached for a flaming morning, but a low ceiling denied her its touch. This darkness was her bed now.  Eos.  She had been named for a goddess. Her grandmother had always abhorred the name. Was hubris the reason she was here? Had she smiled too much?  Everyone had complimented on her beauty. On her honey blonde hair and iridescent light eyes.  She had been...too pretty. Was that it? Was that the fact that had been the catalyst to it all?  Soon, the door would open and all sorts of horrors would befall her. All they would need to do was rip and collect the flower petals. She wondered if she would smell sweet.  She wouldn't open her eyes that's what she decided. Eos would be deaf and numb to it all.  She shivered. It was so dark and cold, even in the summer heat.  This was a burial. A burial of and by darkness.  All she could do was wait for the door to open. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*吴三省红着一双眼，紧搂着吴邪的脖子，随着吴邪的动作上下颠簸，刚开了荤的alpha，好比山野间的饿的眼冒精光的猛兽，更何况这一只觊觎嘴里这道美味不止一日两日，怕是日到天荒地老都不得餍足。 TM的，臭小子，学别的没见有这么快。 吴三省泄愤似的一口咬住吴邪的耳朵，又被吴邪接连而来的猛烈进攻弄的压根没办法用上力，他吴三爷享受归享受，几时被人搞成这副模样，就算是在床上，他吴三爷也是绝对的主导者。 只可惜吴三省如今的模样要是说出这番话，怕不是要被吴邪笑死，再被压在地板上、床上、桌子上，或者随便哪个合适的地方干个八百回。 自然吴三爷心里也是明白这回事的，他现在浑身上下不着寸缕，眼角泛红，周围还有尚未干涸的生理盐水，快感太多，来不及消化好而留在嘴角的涎水，蜷起来的脚趾，无一不显示出他现在极其愉悦。 “吴邪···舒服···” 他整个身子绵软无力，透着好看的粉红，仿佛香甜的蜜桃，布着薄薄的露水，一副熟透了的样子。他仿若无骨，将全部重量交给了吴邪，只有被操的受不了时自己挺起腰才稍稍和吴邪分开一点。 “三叔，大侄子技术好点了吗” “马马、嗯、虎虎吧” 才不是马马虎虎，大概是alpha在这种事情上都有惊人的学习能力，相比于和吴邪来的头两发，这发简直爽得吴三省从头发丝到脚趾尖都在战栗，再加上他大侄子得天独厚的大宝贝，他觉得他可以把这次的性爱放在他人生最爽记录前三。 “哎？看样子三叔对我的水平还不满意啊”吴邪故意停了下来。 已经发泄过三次的alpha明显比较游刃有余了，相对于正处于发情期的omega来说。 “三叔，侄子从小什么都是跟着您学的，我可是您的家传弟子啊” 吴三省正在兴头上，被突然打断，吴邪居然开始一件一件数起来小时候跟他学了什么什么，什么毛病。 “这个您也教教呗。” 吴三省最受不了吴邪这种贱兮兮的语调，臭小子，翅膀硬了，敢戏弄三叔了，他才不是那些娇滴滴的omega，可以随便被快感掌控，他可是在江湖上呼风唤雨的吴三爷。 吴三爷伏在吴邪肩上，热气喷薄在吴邪耳边，搅得吴邪心猿意马，后穴因为刚刚的一波高潮还在一抽一抽，吴邪的肉棒半硬着插在里面，还在不应期。吴三省等稍微恢复了点体力，就从吴邪身上离开，肉棒从后穴里滑出，带出了一些白浊，那些液体顺着吴三省的大腿根蜿蜒而下，看得吴邪不由有些口干舌燥，吞咽口水。 他们俩现在在卧室，吴三省的卧室完全符合他好享受的性格，他背对着吴邪，双手撑在窗户上，高潮的余韵还在，他喘了许久才攒足一点力气，只见他先瞟了吴邪一眼，睫毛根都写着勾引，再把手指一根一根舔湿，暗示意味十足，屁股正对着吴邪翘起，好叫吴邪看得一清二楚。 他缓缓用手指触碰了一下后穴，敏感的一缩一缩的情状被吴邪尽收眼底，吴三省现在可没闲情观察吴邪的表情，他试探着放入一根手指，依旧湿滑的后穴令他放入的十分容易，接着第二根、第三根，自己搅动、抽插的速度越来越快，他发誓他听到了吴邪吞咽唾沫的声音，但吴邪就是呆坐在一旁，没有动作，该不是傻了吧。 吴三省回过头，嫣然一笑，拿出放在后穴的手指，对吴邪轻轻勾了勾。吴邪的老二连同他的魂都被勾了起来，吴邪以最快的速度走到吴三省身后，不等他反应过来就一杆入洞，接着就是狂风骤雨一般的抽插。 吴三省还在发情期，而且设定还是在得到满足之前看到吴邪后穴就会泛滥成灾，操，看上谁不好，偏偏是吴邪。吴三省默默在心里咒骂。 他们俩头一次就无比契合，头一次睡到一起就尝试了门口地板上、沙发上和卧室大床上，而且一次比一次感觉更好，他感到这次他肯定是栽了，他和这个人同住一个屋檐下二十多年，今后可能还得同睡一张床许多年。 “吴邪，我不年轻了。”尽管双腿依旧因为情潮在打颤，呼出的空气都带着信息素，吴三省仍然努力让自己认真起来。 “三叔，我还不够成熟。”吴邪完全懂他。 “我们还是叔侄。” “亲叔侄。” “我挣扎过，但我最终还是失败了。” “我唯一挣扎的就是你会不会爱我。” 年轻人的爱一往无前，年长者的爱深思熟虑。他们之间的障碍会一直存在，可惜爱情此物人力躲不开。 “标记我吧。” “三叔，三省，我爱你。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*This is merging, connecting; it's a meeting of souls and minds. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Hannibal's touch is incredibly gentle against my skin.  He's so careful with his caress, so tender, it feels as if he's offering up a part of himself to me that he's never offered to anyone else: his innermost desires, his vulnerability, his naked heart.  His mouth, so aesthetically pleasing when viewed in the abstract, is the fount of all pleasure when pressed against mine.  I allow myself to feel each and every sensation as he makes love to me with his fingers, his lips, his tongue. Every part of me aches for him as I reciprocate, and together we make the journey to the point of no return.  In my more fevered dreams, I've imagined us up against a wall, half dressed: a quick and desperate release. But this isn't just sex. This is merging, connecting; it's a meeting of souls and minds.  "My darling Will," he says, between kisses, "if you and I were the only two people left in the world tonight, that would be quite all right with me."  I smooth back the hair now falling across his forehead as I return his smile.  And, right at this moment, I think I could live with that too. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Tony learns more about Steve. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Someone entered the workshop, but Tony didn’t look up, he was focused on his calculations.  “Are you going to join us for dinner?”  It was Steve.  “Did you lose the draw?” Tony briefly looked up at Steve.  “I’m making a few tweaks to the gauntlets,” Tony said and held his armored hands up for Steve to see.  “I’ll be up there in a minute.”  He expected Steve to leave, but he didn’t.  Tony sighed and closed the data file.  “Well, let’s go.  Take me to dinner.”  He slid his gauntleted hands down his chest.  He caught Steve watching the move.  He did it again, almost automatically, just to see if Steve was looking where he thought.  His fingers trailed over his nipples, always hard in the cold room.  That was definitely where the other man was looking.  This was an unexpected turn of events.  Steve’s flushed cheeks sent a jolt of arousal through him, and that was also unexpected.  “You like that, Steve?” he asked in a lower voice than he intended.  Steve could only nod.  His mouth hung slightly open as he watched Tony's thumbs tease over himself.  Tony gave his nipples a little pinch.  This would be fun. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Passion and desperation send both women into a frenzy... *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Neither woman would remember how the whole situation started, Mickie had found Fliss in her room and had been happy to see her, finding it all too easy to greet her with a rough, claiming kiss. She had been feeling the psycho within starting to rise, her breath hitching at the power with which Fliss responded, pulling her closer, the two falling into each other.   Mickie had almost growled when Fliss lifted her into her arms, carrying her out to the car, it had taken them very little time to get home, Fliss locking both the car and the house quickly, carrying Mickie to the bedroom, the clothing thrown aside until finally, finally, they had one another naked, Mickie grinding down hard when Fliss lifted her into place, the two moaning into each other’s lips, both women giving themselves over to passion. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Frank likes to be bitten. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Gerard panted, lips wet and dripping with blood. His mouth crashed into Frank's, both moaning into it. Frank clawed at Gerard's back, desperate and high off the venom and blood loss.  "You taste so fuckin good," Gerard breathed, biting at Frank's lip and slicing the skin open. Blood poured into his mouth, making him growl and suck on the wound, pulling Frank closer to him.  Frank whimpered, collapsing into the vampire's arms. He felt faint, but stronger than that was the heady pleasure of his lover's venom coursing through him and the burning pain in his neck and lip.  Gerard kissed Frank frantically, lips moving together almost sloppily in their desperation. Tongues danced between their two mouths and hands roamed everywhere they could reach. They went at it like animals, until Frank broke away with a gasp.  "I think I'm gonna pass out," he whispered. A sudden stab of pain had him swooning, and Gerard's arms tightened around Frank so he wouldn't fall.  Trailing wet, red kisses down Frank's neck, Gerard murmured, "Hang on. I'll clean them up, you'll be fine."  “Kiss me again first.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*蓝河自认不是意志薄弱的人，但是随着时间的逝去，他越是压制，从下半身开始蔓延的热度越是加速了席卷全身的趋势。他的大脑昏昏沉沉，视线也模糊不堪，腕部的金属传来了仅有的微凉，却让他整个身子都情不自禁地想要向床畔贴去。  结果赤裸的下身在沙发表面的布料上摩擦后，却传来了更加刺激的快感，让半硬的性器越发炽热胀痛，戳得生疼。于是被突如其来的情潮冲晕头脑的人挣扎着向前曲起双膝，努力用跪着的姿势高高翘起臀部，让硬挺的部位得以在空气中完全充血勃起。  “这么自觉？”叶修轻笑一声，在他富有弹性的臀部拍了拍，几道浅浅的红色指印没来得及在白皙的皮肤上停留几秒就匆匆消去。  这点异动让蓝河半垂的眼帘抖了抖，涣散的光芒却瞬间收回了不少：“呜……呜，呜……”  “怎么，不高兴了？”叶修跪到蓝河的身侧，手从敞开的衬衣中间大模大样地闯到他的胸前。  叶修微凉的指尖捏住了一直被蓝河视为装饰的两粒乳首，粗糙的薄茧一开始刮得蓝河感觉有些刺痛，苍白的脸色下隐隐透着的更多是羞恼——奈何他口中的纸团就算被唾液打湿了，还是没有缩减多少体积，给他留出抗议的余地。  自己的安眠药被识破了，反而中了对方的春药，又没有安排接应，如此糟糕的局面，莫非要栽在这里了？蓝河胀热的大脑根本无从分析眼下的情势来寻找逃生手段，他的思考被胸前传来的异样频频打断。受到抚慰那处的肉粒颤颤巍巍地立了起来，而无精打采的另一边却催使蓝河扭动上半身把自己往叶修的手里送。  不得不说，锻炼充分的肌肉摸起来手感比看着不知道要爽多少，叶修暗中舔了舔嘴唇，撩起等同于无的衬衫，沿着脊背上的凹陷慢慢向后摸去。  蓝河瞬间想要弹起身，却被早有防备的叶修按住了肩膀，还为了防止他乱动，用膝盖顶到蓝腿间大大分开——将粉嫩的性器和后穴一同暴露在空气中。  被限制了言语功能的人喉咙里翻滚着低吼，从塞了异物的口中传出却像困兽挣扎时发出的呜咽；他的眼底也像是燃起了火苗，映在叶修眼中看着是一对亮晶晶的眸子，夹杂着难以自制浮现的水光……  不愧是他一眼相中的人，不论是曾经某次任务中的惊鸿一瞥，还是招来当模特后不加掩饰的专注品味，怎么看怎么好看。  原本还在抚摸柔软臀肉的手指不知不觉溜到了前方，握住了男人身上最敏感的部位，药效充分侵占了蓝河的大脑，本能叫嚣着让他挺腰，试图在叶修手里寻求更多的快感。出乎意料的，叶修非但没有挪开手，反而饶有兴致地看着他在自己手里耸动，甚至配合地用手指刮蹭顶部开始流淌的小眼，激得蓝河眼角泛红，难耐地趴在了枕头上。  也许是看他发不出声的模样太过难熬，叶修大发慈悲地掏出了蓝河口中湿哒哒的纸团，漏出了压抑许久的呻吟。被打湿的两指没有回到原本扶着的肩膀上，反而探向了后方，配合前面有节奏的撸动，探入紧致炽热的小穴。  在药效的发挥下，探入的手指没有搅动太久，肠液就自动开始向穴口蔓延，叶修加快了手里的动作，将自己早就硬得不行的性器从裤子里解放出来，抵着不停开合的穴口磨蹭。腺液配合着肠液濡湿了怎么看都满含邀请意味的小嘴，螺纹的安全套让硬到翘立的肉棒越发像是狰狞的巨型铁钉，一点一点向蓝河柔软的深处进发。  胀痛感实在鲜明，却在药的影响下放大了摩擦产生的愉悦而变得不那么难以忍受，叶修小心翼翼地把自己整根埋入后又给了不断喘息的人好一会缓冲时间，才不紧不慢地动了起来。  精瘦的窄腰被卡在有力的手指间，随着撞击幅度的增大前后晃动，蓝河搂紧了身下的狭窄沙发，被顶上要命的地方时，终于在胸腹间溅上了浓稠的白液。  高潮使肠壁不由自主地收缩挤压被自己含住的东西，爽得叶修也放慢动作生怕自己一不小心同样交代出来。  释放后的大脑一片空白，但蓝河的嘴里却断断续续地吐出了字眼：“卑……卑鄙！”  “礼尚往来而已，准你给我茶水里下料，不准我试试新到的货？”趴在他身后的男人舔了舔蓝河的耳垂，欠揍的语气都似乎在蓝河眼前活灵活现地刻画出了一张笑眯眯的脸——怎么看都像是蓄谋已久，“还有更卑鄙的药呢，我可是善良又乐于助人的好市民，要是你想试试我不介意帮你打一管……”  话音未落，原本低垂的头颅却猛地向后扬起，若不是叶修反应快，如果撞到他的鼻梁骨，估计不是顿好受的。  还埋在他身体里的硬物狠狠往内顶了一下来宣誓存在感，这猝不及防的动作硬是磨出了一连串细碎的呻吟，让蓝河刚刚发泄过的性器又有了抬头的意思。  叶修的手又贴回了蓝河的胸前，随着掌心的摩挲，两枚发硬的乳头被搓揉得越发红肿。就在蓝河以为他的注意力重新转移回自己胸前时，那两只手却一把搂住他的身子，就着连接的状态翻了个面，螺纹刮蹭着敏感的凸起处，挤出蓝河喉咙间一声尖叫。  没等他回过神，又是一阵天旋地转，叶修竟然抱着他躺了下去，硬是让蓝河变成了坐在自己身上的姿势。  粗长的性器随着骑乘的姿势钉入肠道更深的内里，足够紧致，更加炽热，咬得叶修满足喟叹。  “急什么，没吃饱咱们继续？”他探头舔舐之前被自己把玩过的乳首，含含糊糊地从牙缝里挤出几个字，就迫不及待地重新叼住充血的小圆粒吮吸。  一波接着一波的刺激让蓝河的眼角拖下一条清浅的泪痕，他像溺水的鱼儿般大口呼吸起来。  “继续……就继续！”     【请允许我先打个TBC！！！！！！！】 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Chris is gone. He’s in the hole for fighting and Toby aches for him. He’s relieving every moment of their sloppy, glorious kiss and he’s hard but too tired to jerk off. He’s straight but he’s desperate to kiss the guy again. So maybe he’s not so straight after all. All he can do is recall the feel of those soft yet demanding lips on his own, and it doesn’t help his hard on. It’s then he finds the leftover moonshine. He takes a sip and then one more and then he feels a strong buzz of welcome escapism. Toby is lost in a dream of fucking Chris, riding that glorious ass, and plunging into his heated depths with his hard dick for a guide. Dream-Chris is writhing on it like a rodeo rider and Toby feels how good it is. He comes, and Chris howls for him, all fire and life. Toby wakes up alone, covered in his own jizz and with the sheets smelling of vomit and spunk. His head aches, and he’s more alone than before. Well at least Chris is coming back. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*所有人都认为濑名泉是个和善的人，虽然有些高傲，但是待人还是有礼，那张完美的脸和微笑更是大杀器。但他们也都知道，濑名泉面对游木真时才有更多的情绪，没有那张完美的假面，情绪也是丰富得很。但偶尔的时候，当这个男人的恶趣味正式上线时，游木真也招架不住。  就比如现在。明明两个人最开始的时候观看当红的电视节目也是十分开心，但后来也不知道是哪一点不对，两个人开始接吻，之后的一切出乎游木意料之内，却也在情理之中。  濑名泉从后面环抱住游木真，右手在游木真的挺立上撸动着，仔细的照顾到每一点。左手沾了些润滑剂在后庭做着扩张，柔软的内壁被手指一点一点的抚摸过，慢慢前进的像个正在探秘的勇士。  濑名泉对游木真身上的敏感点一清二楚，对如何撩拨他，领着他高潮更是了如指掌。  濑名泉张口含住游木真的耳垂，轻轻的撕咬着，然后就感受到游木真整个人颤抖了一下，后壁也是一阵收缩。游木真听见耳边濑名泉粗重的呼吸声，耳朵整个似乎都处在一个难耐的高温中，只感觉像快要融化。  “别……别咬……啊……”  对游木真的话濑名泉是充耳不闻，反而变本加厉的含住了整只耳朵，清晰的水声让游木真不由自主的想起先前做的时候发出的某些声音，于是他身上的粉红上升成了大红。  在后穴的敏感点被无意的碰到后，游木真终于受不住射了出来。  “好孩子……”濑名泉松口对他说。手指在扩张的差不多时被抽出来，突然的空虚感让游木真反射性的收紧了后穴。  但就在游木真以为这是一场和以往一样的性事之时，濑名泉将他抱到自己面前，然后顺势躺下，对游木真说:“这种事情，遊君应该也熟悉了吧？”  愣了三秒的游木真在了解到自家恋人的意思的时候简直快哭出来。  ……就算熟悉又怎么可能做的出来。  在这种事情上游木向来是被动的那一方，因为害羞和一些其他不知名的情绪，他很少在这方面做些主动的事，能够配合就已经算是极限了。而濑名泉也一直迎着他，对他也没有其他的要求。但这一次濑名泉似乎是来了兴致，偏要游木真主动，在中途采用了骑乘式。  游木真跪坐在濑名泉身上，刚刚高潮带来的兴奋还在继续，他的大腿在微微的颤抖，呼吸也仍旧急促着。他低头看着身下的濑名泉，却全然没有居高临下的感觉，后庭经过刚才的一番扩张，空虚感越来越浓重，想要被他占有，被填满的心愿积在心口，满满的快要溢出来。  “……泉、泉さん……”游木真最终还是忍不住开口。被欲望折磨后的声音自然的带上些诱人的甜腻，软软的又带着小小的哭腔，像是幼崽被欺负的狠了的呜咽。  泉不理他，伸手慢慢的在游木真两侧的腰部摩挲，一下一下轻的像羽毛划过，却又加重游木想要的欲望，“有些事情，遊君自己来比较好哦。”  带着引诱的声音响起，一点一点摧毁游木心里的防线。  简直就是恶魔……  游木想。  终于，决定忠于欲望的游木开始动了，慢慢的撑起自己，对准身后抵着自己的滚烫事物后又一点一点坐下。理想和实际上的差距还是有的，即使经过了扩张，但真正用起来却还是紧的不像话。  濑名泉看着身上慢慢动作的游木真，感受到游木身后温暖而湿润的甬道紧密的贴合着他的欲望，他看着游木真翠绿的眼睛里充满了欲望，却又因为疼痛而被挤出了几滴眼泪，蕴在那双眼睛里，让他看起来更加可怜，更让他喜欢。  不止是这张脸，软软的性格也好，不愿放弃的坚持也好，就算是讨厌他的那一部分也都喜欢的不得了。想要永远霸占他，让他待在自己身边，只看到自己的愿望从来没有消退过。即使是已经在交往的现在，濑名泉也会有这些疯狂的想法，甚至日益加深。  想要亲吻的念头一旦滋生就无法控制，虽然濑名泉在这段感情中看起来像是处在上位者的一方，但其实，如果游木真想要切断这段关系，他就什么也做不了。所以，有时候他也会害怕，不确定这一切是否只是一场梦。  濑名泉扶着游木真的腰坐起来，过程中不小心擦过那让游木兴奋的一点，引来游木的一声呻吟和一阵战栗，于是濑名泉又恶意的对着那一点狠狠地顶了一下，惹来游木一个瞪视，却因为充满的欲望而显得像在引诱。  濑名泉轻吻着游木的眼睛，鼻子，脸颊，最后落在他的嘴唇上。他描绘着游木的唇形，濑名泉极喜欢游木的嘴唇，薄厚刚好，唇色淡淡的，嘴角永远有着一个美好的弧度，像小猫一样的。濑名泉勾出游木真的舌头，与其共舞，舌尖时不时擦过游木真的上颚，更勾起游木真心底的欲望。有时候游木真也会怀疑濑名泉是否真的如他自己所说，从未谈过恋爱，毕竟那些技巧他运用的实在是太过娴熟了。  游木真还在缓慢律动着，因为疼痛他一直不敢有什么大的动作，但这样却让濑名泉受不了，毕竟他忍的也实在够久了。于是濑名泉伸手按住游木真的腰，带着他加快了速度。  两个人姿势没变，可是主动权却已经被转交到濑名泉手上。  “……遊君真是漂亮呢，这个样子是只有我才能看到的。怎么办想到这个我就想要的更多……遊君……”  “啊……够了，不，不要，嗯再说了……嗯……”  濑名泉扣着游木真的腰，带着他在自己身上律动，游木真靠在濑名泉肩上，嘴里发出一声又一声的呻吟，黏腻的像蜜糖。  “……慢…一点……啊……”  “泉さん……”  但濑名泉却始终照着自己性子来，不会伤到游木真，同时自己也能彻底的品尝到他的味道。  几分钟过后，游木真就受不住再次射了出来，两个人的身上被白浊弄得一塌糊涂。濑名泉转头在游木真通红的眼角留下细密的吻，将他的泪水全都带走。  濑名泉开口安慰他:“乖……”他的声音低沉喑哑，游木真知道他也快了。  “泉さん……”  游木真刚刚开口，就感受到一股滚烫的液体打在自己体内。  这个人明明坏透了。  游木真看着似乎还打算再来一次的濑名泉心里默默腹诽。     今天难得没有通告是个悠闲的休息日，他可以和他的恋人在家里或其他什么地方待上一整天。  床头柜上的闹钟显示现在是早上六点五十三分，他怀里的游木真因为昨天晚上的疯狂还在继续安睡着。濑名泉微笑，水色的眼睛里盛满了爱意和温情。  反正还有一整天，再睡个回笼觉也没有什么所谓。     —FIN. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*握住蔡徐坤命根的手微微一动，蔡徐坤敏感地一抖身体，抬起眼睛瞪范丞丞，怒斥他：“你干嘛！”  范丞丞闭嘴不说话，面带厉色，手下却不停，用劲撕破蔡徐坤的底裤，下狠心往破洞里伸进去，掌心和那处来了个肉贴肉。  蔡徐坤再傻也知道范丞丞要干嘛了，他又惊又怕，以为范丞丞不耐烦起来，真要绝他的种，想着君子不立危墙之下，此刻先服个软，待日后再计较不迟，因此软下声音：“你别，你听我说，这件事我可以……”  范丞丞哪耐烦听他讲条件，他还怕蔡徐坤一个枣子一棒槌，安抚他后立马挖个坑给他跳，此时硬下心肠把他制服了，好过和他虚与委蛇掰扯条件。他一只手在下路，一只手要按住蔡徐坤，只能委屈自己用嘴堵住蔡徐坤的嘴。  蔡徐坤吓傻了，他以为的并不是范丞丞要做的，这个范丞丞能想出欺君的法子，胆大包天，怎么会想不出其他下三滥的法子，这人比自己还小两岁，竟这般寡廉鲜耻。他摇头要避开范丞丞的唇齿，想不到范丞丞当真狠人，咬住他的嘴唇，直接将那淫舌伸了进来。  其实这两只童子鸡，谁都不会，却以为对方很会，糊头糊脑亲了半天，真叫瞎猫碰上死耗子，亲出了反应来。  蔡徐坤差点要哭出来，自己怎能如此不争气，在犯二面前失了颜面，被个男人亲到升旗，他还不如真断子绝孙呢！范丞丞心道正合我意，他自己起反应的怪不得我，手下一扯一拽，就把蔡徐坤的外裤里裤全剥光了。  银勾挂起绣床帷幕，洞房花烛，自当春色无度，只是这房内雌雄颠倒阴阳逆转，实在光怪陆离。小世子张开两条细白长腿，那根竖起的性器被喜服前襟遮住，那压在身上新妇百般捏弄，很快就湿漉漉出了水儿。他嘴不得闲，手使劲儿推搡，急出一脑门细汗，满室幽兰之气又浓重几分。  “你甭白着急了，你这香味熏不晕我。”范丞丞趁换气松开对方嘴唇的当口，劝蔡徐坤省点力气。他自己硬的难受，不指望蔡徐坤能来救急，只好往蔡徐坤腿间磨蹭，八幅湘裙层层叠叠有些碍事，他腾不出手去解，只得忍着，换过气继续去亲蔡徐坤，手下更卖力地弄他。  不消片刻蔡徐坤闷哼一声，真正卸了力气，眼泪止不住往外冒，碎珍珠一样落在鸳鸯软枕上。范丞丞总算能起身了，掀开蔡徐坤的喜服前襟，见他腿间一片污浊，竟是泄了不少出来。  “你这个淫棍！下三滥的混蛋！我饶不了你！”  范丞丞才不理他，解了半天裙子，发现自己根本不会解，只得撩起裙子解开里裤，把自己的那根东西放出来，抹上蔡徐坤泄出来的玩意，对人家拱手道了一句：“得罪！”  就这样直接挺了进去，蔡徐坤疼得直哭，翻来覆去淫棍杀千刀的几个词骂范丞丞，待到后来范丞丞不知得了什么神通，在那一丝丝的痛里开始有了一点点痛快。他咬牙切齿，终究顶不过那点子快意，唇齿间漏出一声呻吟，范丞丞方知道蔡徐坤也不光全是痛楚。他到底心怀愧疚，觉得对不起蔡徐坤，知道了他也会舒服，便只往那地方捅，蔡徐坤被他弄得恨也不是，痛快更不是，眼泪流的更凶了。  “你怎么越哭越厉害？”  “你，”蔡徐坤哭狠了，打了个嗝，借着骂，“你管我，黄鼠狼给鸡拜年不安好心！”  范丞丞的好心被当成驴肝肺，气的狠狠捅了两下，把蔡徐坤分开在他身侧的腿都刺激软了，他过意不去，觉得蔡徐坤这样必然难受，将两条长腿架在肩上，期待让他舒服些。  他哪里知道这才真要了蔡徐坤的命，这些他能进得更深了，原先那一点点的痛快突然发了洪水，要把蔡徐坤卷进漩涡里去，蔡徐坤根本不及挣扎，没顶的快意让他再度泄了出来。范丞丞也不能久持，也一同泄出。  床上是铺了喜帕的，范丞丞退出蔡徐坤身体后，那处被蹂躏鞑伐的小洞里涌出白浊体液，还混了股股血丝，红红白白地染在喜帕上，真合了洞房花烛夜了。  范丞丞把喜帕从蔡徐坤身下抽出来，叠了成四方塞进前襟，对蔡徐坤道：“这喜帕上头的东西你知道是什么，你要是不按着我说的办，我就把这东西拿出来，到时候两家人都没脸。”说完不管蔡徐坤铁青的脸色，去梳妆台取来眉刀，割破自己的手指，把血抹在床单上。 *~*TEXT*~*

He told me, we removed all of our clothes and he kept kissing my neck. " I need you Matt." I whimpered as he entered me, my walls tightening around his warm hot length. " You feel so welcoming." He mouthed against my temple, he began to thrust, it was as I was overheating, but I didn't care. " Matt please." I moaned as I felt his thrust hitching, I wanted to cum, he groaned in my ear. " I'm gonna cum." He groaned as I wrapped my legs around his waist. " Please." I begged, he sunk deep and came deep within me, I cried out as I felt my orgasm rise, he rode both our orgasms out. " Thank you." I whimpered as he pulled out, he then laid upon his back. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*  "Imagine Blue Pearl having a big ass crush on Pearl, and whenever she's around her, BP gives her gentle hugs and kisses and just wants to be close to her all the time" - Anon   "Does Yellow Pearl get jealous when BP gives Pearl hugs and kisses?" - Anon "She does get a little jealous, but not for long..."   **END OF SFW**       A Pearl/Blue Pearl roleplay scene: Pearl’s been captured, and Blue is preparing her to be brought before Blue Diamond, dressing her up in luxurious bondagewear and wearing her down with edging and fingers in her hair and sweet kisses. Blue wants the satisfaction of breaking the spirit of the rebel she secretly admires, while Pearl struggles to resist the pleasure and submission she’s spent thousands of years fighting against.  (And, of course, when it’s over, there’s lots of cuddling and gentle aftercare and Pearl reaffirms that she belongs to No One.) *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*They are not gentle. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*They are not gentle men, the Royal Protector and the new Spymaster. They’ve learned to be. When and where necessary. Trading the clenched fist for holding the hand of a lost child, the wielding of a blade for the light touch of fingers to a lover’s skin. But they don’t have to be gentle with each other. And they aren’t. In training, Corvo and Daud refrain from permanent injury, but bruises and cuts are plentiful. In the bedroom—or in the study, or the hidden room that once belonged to the Empress, or up against the wall in the shadows of the training yard—fingers and mouths track the sparring wounds, overlap them with half-moon marks from short nails, the imprint of teeth, so deep it seems as though the biter was trying to reach bone. And if, occasionally, those marks are left high enough for others in the Tower to see, no one comments. *~*TEXT*~*

She MATTERS.....”  The slap that follows is enough to knock Stephanie down, Fliss all but exploding from her seat, taking Vince down hard, her fingers digging into his throat with a growl, her voice fierce.   “You....”  She doesn’t finish her sentence, pressing down harder until Vince is out cold, kicking him viciously twice, her voice harsh.  “Bastard.”  Her touch is softer as she moves to pull Stephanie up, her voice low and harsh.   “He’s not worth it....”  “How could he?”  “I don’t know...”  Fliss’ voice is soft, leading Stephanie away, her words quiet.   “I’m calling the police. Tonight.”  It had taken weeks to get the truth from Mickie, her voice low and broken as she admitted how she had really bled, her words dragging memories up that Stephanie had buried, her heartbreak clear as she sobbed into Fliss’ shoulder that night.   Vince would be taken away, they could only hope it would be the end. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The scream echoes in the night and, before anyone else can move, Fliss moves, racing towards the room, pushing through people who have gathered, hating the fear fluttering in her chest. It had sounded final. She hadn’t bothered dressing, her shorts and sports bra barely covering her, blonde hair tangled and messy, hazel eyes wide and fearful.   “SheWolf...”  “No... No...”  Fliss pulls away from Stephanie, pushing into the room, staring at the mess, her breath catching at the sight of the woman on the bed, bandaged and sobbing, curled into herself, hating herself for believing she had lost her for even a moment.   “What happened?”  “The usual.”  Fliss growls then, softly, moving to scoop the woman into her arms, carrying her from the room, her voice low and firm as she passes Stephanie.   “He needs to be banned from Raw.”  “He’s my....”  “No. He hurt her. Twice. She did nothing to deserve this.”  Fliss continued on her way, locking herself in and curling around the other woman, stroking the soft honey-coloured hair from her eyes, hating the flinch.   “I’m not going anywhere.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*周泽楷灵活的手指探进去的时候很顺利，之前已经做过一次，叶修的穴口还带着残余的湿润，不费力气就吞进他的两根手指。不过周泽楷没有着急，他耐心的做着扩张，放轻呼吸来听清叶修在耳边的逐渐加快的喘息。他们仍旧面对面保持着相拥的姿势，叶修半跪在周泽楷面前，两手搭在他身上，随着颤动不住的乱晃，屁股微微撅起，好让他的手顺着背部流畅的线条滑至那个私密的、能给予两人欢愉的地方，叶修的下巴不自觉的在他肩上来回蹭磨，似乎在催促。  周泽楷呼吸粗重了一些，但还是忍耐着伸进了第三根手指。他们以往的做爱没有一次像今天这样温吞又温柔的，总是天雷勾地火一样热烈到烫人，毕竟他们没那么多的时间。周泽楷轻柔的舔噬叶修的耳垂，像是要弥补昨晚的粗暴，他身体力行的把心里澎湃的感情传递给叶修，告诉他：来日方长。  周泽楷不会说，只能做。  叶修的喘息声露出了一条裂缝，叹息般的呻吟在黑暗中顿时发酵成上好的催情，整个空气都黏稠起来。周泽楷把叶修往上提了提，还在他里面的手来回搅弄敏感点，叶修防线全面崩溃，腰肢难耐的扭动，炽热的内穴拼命的绞紧收缩，像是要把手指吞得更深。  听着叶修乱作一团的呼吸，周泽楷完成了漫长的扩张，他抽出手指，空气中爆发出滑腻的水声和情欲的香气，叶修的声音一下拔高。  周泽楷一手箍住叶修的腰，一手温柔的在他背上游走，抹开变凉的薄汗。叶修从他肩窝里直起身子，顺着周泽楷的指引，坐到了他上挑直挺的欲望上，穴口的褶皱甫一撑开，黑暗里的呼吸声就急促起来，毫无章法的四散响起。  周泽楷对叶修把主控权交给自己有点惊讶，要知道，床上的叶修一向是有攻击性的，即使陷在情欲的浪潮里，还总是想着接管两人的节奏，而此时的“顺从”无非表明了一点，无上的信任与包容。想到这儿，周泽楷连血液都沸反盈天起来，叫嚣着占有他，操哭他。  许是性器又涨大了几分，叶修吃痛了一声陷得更深一点，腰颤抖起来，撑在周泽楷肩膀上的手脱力的弯曲，整个人倒在他怀里。周泽楷抚着叶修的尾椎，好让他坐到底部，这样不上不下，对两人来说都是煎熬。  叶修吃满的时候，两人一齐长舒了一口气，叶修扒在他身上，像是被抽走了力气，柔软的好像一滩水。周泽楷开始动作，缓慢而有力的撞击，叶修的呻吟鼻音浓重，夹杂在一浪接一浪的水声中显得淫乱非常。周泽楷拉开叶修，修长的手指循上他的脸，摸过微张的嘴唇，摸上颧骨，摸上温热的眼睛，令他意外的是，叶修没有哭。  对啊，叶修怎么会这样就哭呢。  “干嘛…”叶修在周泽楷的起伏里喘着说了句话，低低的笑声从颤抖的胸腔里发出，像是管弦乐队里和音用的低音提琴。  “想看我哭了没有？”就算沦陷在别人的节奏了，他还是有精力调笑一句。  “嗯，我以为你哭了。”  “呵。”叶修示威的咬上周泽楷的耳朵，对着里面吹了口气，“想让我哭还差得远呢。”  周泽楷笑了起来，他把在自己耳边作恶的人拎到面对面的位置，虽说是面对面，但叶修的脸不过是黑暗中更深的一层黑暗罢了，可是就是这更深一层的黑暗却总有着随时会绽放出光芒的力量。  “我会努力…”周泽楷突然发力，咬住叶修的嘴唇，直接推倒，狠狠压了上去，把叶修没说出口的惊呼吞进口中。  “操哭你。”周泽楷贴着叶修呼出灼热的呼吸，然后不等身下人反应过来就疯狂的抽动起来。  “啊啊啊慢点啊啊…啊啊啊！”  叶修脑袋狂乱的摇动，双腿死死的勾住他的腰，小穴里不断的分泌出粘稠的爱液，硬挺的欲望前端也像是要喷射。  周泽楷丝毫没有慢下来的迹象，反而变本加厉，不断地加速冲刺起来。  “不要…不…啊唔…”  叶修缴械投降，生理泪水不断涌出，周泽楷温柔的舔干净，下身却更凶猛的撞击，叶修被带着在床单上磨擦，些许的粗糙痛感使得那快感味道顿时丰富到令人窒息。  “哭了。”周泽楷笑。  “妈的…啊啊…”叶修没好气的抽泣，然后彻底沉进了名为周泽楷的浪潮中。     “叶修…”  “叶修…”  “我爱你…”  叶修被极端的快感逼得说不出话，一开口就是散成一片的甜腻呻吟，这不妨碍周泽楷深情的声音灌进脑袋了，像魔咒一样回荡。  “叶修，我爱你，别走。”  叶修搂住他。明明自己才是背负的那一个，周泽楷却同样承担着苦痛与挣扎，像海藻一样紧紧缠住自己，缠住那仅剩的希望。  周泽楷做着最后的冲刺，在令人头晕目眩的绞紧中和叶修一起释放了出来，然后疲倦的抱住他。     叶修拍拍他颤抖的背，睁开被泪水糊住的眼睛望向窗外。     “小周。”  “嗯？”周泽楷声音闷闷的。  “看。”叶修指向远处。     鸟儿清脆的叫声划破天空，窗外微弱光线弥漫开来。  黎明到了。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Recently, Kent had found himself unable to stop thinking about the Sliver Shroud, also known as Tony Miller. It had started with Kent imagining Tony shirtless, then Tony bursting into his room and confessing his love until it finally culminated in Kent imagining Tony bursting into his room, completely naked and confessing his love before they had sex.      One afternoon, Kent was about halfway through one of these secret fantasies when Tony walked in, a thin, brown paper package tucked under his arm.   “Hey!” Kent cried, jumping to his feet.   “Afternoon, Kent. Am I interrupting something?”   “No, not at all! What do you need?”   “I just came to drop off this comic I found. It looks like an unreleased Silver Shroud comic. Are you okay? You seem a little flustered.” Tony asked, raising an eyebrow and walking over to hand him the package.   “Oh, thank you. I’m fine. You just surprised me.” Kent assured him, blushing and accepting it, “Is that everything?”  “Yeah.” Tony said as he walked back towards the door. Kent nodded.   “Um… bye.”  “See ya around.” Tony called, striking the Silver Shroud’s iconic pose before winking and shutting the door, “Don’t worry, I’ll knock in the future.” *~*TEXT*~*

A grin crossed Mycroft’s lips as he pushed back against Greg’s erection.  “I suppose England will not fall if you keep me in bed a few more minutes.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Fork and knife in his pockets, he burst through the door.      The black mist covering the burglar disallowed Squidward from seeing who was trying to rob him.  “Squiiiiidwaaarrrd…..” The deep, raspy, SEXY voice drawled out.     “Who’s there!? I have ink, a-and I’m not afraid to u-use it-!”     The figure stepped out of the mist, S-SPONGEBOB!?     Spongebob grabbed Squidward, and put him on all fours-six’s?     Spongebob licked Squidwards ass, it felt….  Divine.     Spongebob pulled down his pants, and out came a big, juicy,    Blunt.    Squidward gasped. “S-spongebob! No, wait-!”     The blunt was shoved inside of Squidward’s ass.  Squidward screams from pain and intense pleasure.     “Daddy! Please more!” Squidward cries.     “B. E. G.” Spongebob orders.  Squidward moans. “Please  DADDY.  Ruin my ass!”  The blunt made Squidwards ass a cave.  “D. A. D. D. Y. ‘ S. C. O. M. I. N.

*~*TEXT*~*He knows he’s not in hell. Not yet. Salt in the air. At the edges of his poked out tongue. But there’s a faint scent of brimstone ashes in his breath. The heat spreading along his spine. His soul’s on fire. His body’s aching in phantom inferno.    With his lips on the curve of her spine, whiskey-stained breath on the nape of her neck, he says, “Let’s celebrate my slow descent to hell, with a toast to my sins—” His fingers playing at the tab collar threatening to choke his neck.  She whispers, throaty and alluringly sweet, “Worship my altar for your sins are my making and mine.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*01.  范丞丞没想过这件事会来得这么快。 他趴在蔡徐坤身上，男人金棕色的碎发铺散在枕头，头顶明晃晃的白炽灯让男人展露出的身体白花花得有些晃眼，明亮的眼睛又夹带着太多惊喜和期待，以至于事到临头，他连后悔的话都憋在嗓眼里无法说出来。  男人抓着他的后颈，嘴唇顺着他的下巴吻到了唇心。 范丞丞耳根不受控制地热起来，心上人的亲近让未经情事的男孩羞怯地垂下眼睫，被动地张开嘴唇迎合。 只是还未等他全副心神投入到这个亲吻里，抓在后腰的手漫不经心揉捏着臀肉的动作让他又再度浑身紧绷起来。  陈立农将润滑剂对着他身体的入口，冰凉的液体咕噜着挤进身体，他落在蔡徐坤身上的手下意识地收紧。 男人靠过来细碎地啄吻着他的侧脸，软下嗓音喊他的名字。 “丞丞，放松点丞丞。” 他抬起带着潮湿水汽的眼，对方柔和的面部轮廓带着惹人心悸的美感，嘴角噙着一点笑，红润的嘴唇落在他的嘴唇，舌尖挑开他紧咬的牙关，勾住他的舌头，让他整个人像被抽了骨头一样软了下来。  他晃神间想起第一次见到男人的时候。 彼时自己在班级里的身份还未曝光，却和姐姐被狗仔拍到出入酒店的照片，在班里遭受了场莫名的校园暴力。那天他蜷缩在陌生的屋檐下，外面是密密的雨帘，轰鸣的雷声就好像他糟糕透顶的心情，冷风吹得他忍不住将脸埋在膝盖上小声地啜泣。  蔡徐坤就是在那个时候，撑着伞穿过密集的雨帘走到他跟前。 高二那年对方还不像现在这样如同一支熟透的蔷薇无声地释放着自己的馥郁与性感，却也已经有了精致到让人见之忘俗的轮廓。 黑色的伞面打下的阴影让泪眼模糊的范丞丞无法看清少年脸上的细节，只知道对方从袋子里取出了一支暖烘烘的罐装咖啡，贴在他额头上，热意一直从脑门烫进了四肢百骸，以至于他只能傻傻地眨巴着眼，看着少年从身侧经过，走进了楼道。 一楼的感应灯亮起又暗下，范丞丞捧着烫手的咖啡，恍惚地红了耳根。  再见时已是高三，身份曝光后姐姐帮他办理了转校手续，站在新班级的讲台上，他几乎是一眼就认出角落里支着下巴看他的人是那日碰上的少年。 一场无声的暗恋从那日一直延续到了今天。  陈立农手指抠进身体的陌生触感让他一个激灵从尾椎直抖上大脑，乱跑的思绪也归拢回了眼前。他控制不住自己低喘着离开蔡徐坤的双唇，把头埋在恋人的肩上，侧过头去看身后的男人。 从他的角度甚至无法通过那副反光的眼镜看清对方眼底的神色，紧绷的下颌线却已经汇起了从鬓角滑落了汗水，往日里时常看到的笑容没有在这场性爱里出现在对方的脸上，失去了那一层颜色的男人看上去像是什么冷酷无情的电影角色。  对方在下一秒抽出了手指，将戴了套的性器顶在他的入口。 范丞丞下意识地要躲，跟前却是蔡徐坤。 男人的眼中带着雀跃的笑意，轻笑着他的嘴唇时拈在他的乳头。范丞丞头一次发现自己的身体敏感得有些过分，只不过是指尖的一个触碰，他就能整个人犹如触电一样地从胸膛炸开酥麻。  在同一个瞬间，陈立农的阴茎贯进他的身体。 疼痛先一步抵达到大脑，没怎么吃过苦头的小少爷噙着两泡泪眼把脸埋进了恋人的肩膀，得到了男人抚慰的落在耳根的亲吻。 “你真可爱，丞丞。” 蔡徐坤的指尖捏着他单薄的乳肉揉搓着，立在胸膛上的乳粒已被蹂躏得通红，男人对那里爱不释手。  “看看我呀，丞丞。” 亲吻又落到了他颈后，突出的椎骨被含进口腔又舔又咬，和身后的疼痛一起折磨着范丞丞的神经，他却仍旧在男人的催促声中迟缓地抬起脸，将红彤彤的眼角和鼻尖暴露在面容精致的男人面前。  蔡徐坤捧住他的脸，将唇齿凑上前，细碎地啃咬着他的颊肉。 他听见男人含在亲吻里的声音，又低又柔地说：“你真是个惊喜，宝宝。” 随后陈立农在男人含笑的提议声里，掐着他的腰将他往后拽去。  由趴改坐的姿势让本就在身体里肆虐的阴茎进入到前所未有的深度，进出间反复地磨蹭着肠壁，范丞丞在低呼声中猛地颤栗了一下，双腿大开地靠进身后不算十分宽阔的胸膛。 蔡徐坤跪在他张开的双腿中间，扶着他的胸膛在他颈间落下一个个潮湿的印迹。  被反复揉捏过的乳粒落进灼热的口腔，范丞丞几乎需要咬着手背，才能制止住那些脱口而出的呻吟。 耳根在怔忡间有冰凉又冷硬的东西贴了上来，全然陌生却滚烫的气息落在耳畔，范丞丞知道那是陈立农。他强忍着羞意，试图侧头避开，却反将曲线拉长，让对方轻易地咬上修长的颈项。  蔡徐坤的另一只手圈上了他半硬的阴茎，迅速在对方手里变得精神起来的性器将他对男人爱慕展露得一丝不挂，他在被前后玩弄的矛盾里渐渐体会到了更多的快感，哑着嗓子喊身后的人慢一些。 陈立农却像只蛮牛一样，像打桩机一样将阴茎肏进他的身体，让他不由自主地在上下颠簸里背过手去揪住对方早已汗湿的头发。  他没能坚持多久地就在前后夹击中射了出来。 浑浊的精液射在了蔡徐坤干净白皙的胸膛，范丞丞慌乱地要伸手去抹，却被男人十指交扣地握住。 蔡徐坤在他手背的咬痕上啄了一下，另一只手蹭了点胸膛上下滑的精液，随后在范丞丞泛着水光的注视中将手指含进口腔。  脑子里轰的一声鸣响，范丞丞在对方一番动作里大脑空白地在陈立农的一个撞击里喊出了声。 之后像是什么开关开启了就无法轻易闭上，断断续续的声音和吸气声，间或夹杂着他含糊喊着蔡徐坤三个字的声音，在房间里将欲火燃得更旺。  陈立农在几个快速地抽插里射了出来。 沉甸甸的安全套箍着发泄后依旧可观的阴茎滑出潮湿的入口，最初挤进范丞丞身体冰冷的润滑剂全化在了因为摩擦而变得高温的肠道里，随着陈立农的动作流淌而出，一滴滴地落在床单上，晕开一片深色。  蔡徐坤和陈立农交换了位置。 眼前的恋人骤然变成了一张虽然也总是看见，却从未投予更多关注的男人，范丞丞的第一反应是要挡，但他身上没有一处不是对方看过的，连身体的深处对方也在方才刚进行过探索，这种无意义的挣扎让他羞窘地咬紧下唇，别开头不去看跟前的人。  “丞丞？”蔡徐坤在身后喊他的名字，范丞丞忙不迭地转过头，男人从后方探过来吻住他的嘴唇，将身体插进他已经被肏开的入口。 等男人进去了，范丞丞才发现他没有戴套，借着还彻底化开的润滑剂腻滑的触感，在肠壁层叠的包裹里深深浅浅没有章法地抽插起来。他甚至可以在这个亲吻的间隙里在脑海里勾勒出对方的形状，大抵因为是这个人，所以即使没有遵照约定地直接进来，他也通通可以原谅。 只要是蔡徐坤。  被堵住了口腔和敏感的身体再度被摩擦出的快感让范丞丞有些透不过气来，等男人松开他后，他几乎只能头晕目眩地歪靠在对方的身上，软绵绵像没骨头一样地将手垂落在一旁。 他迷蒙的视线对上跟前用打量的视线扫视着他身体的陈立农，松下的神经又再度紧绷起来。  陈立农脸上不像刚刚操弄自己那会儿那样全无表情，汗涔涔的脸和肩膀让他有种难以形容的硬气，和那张本质上可以说是柔和清秀的面孔形成了一股矛盾的反差，却又融合得恰到好处。 他打量人的时候垂敛着的眼角随着眉梢的扬起也跟着微微上吊，嘴角好似有着若有若无的笑意，就好像下一秒就要笑出声来。  范丞丞在身体进出的人换成了蔡徐坤后敏感度就翻倍地增长，抑制不住的声音不断从喉间满溢出来，克制地吞咽成了呜咽。 陈立农伸过手来揪住他泛红的乳尖，想起这人跟只傻乎乎的兔子一样一头撞在蔡徐坤这根木桩上，整张脸都涨得通红，却一脸笃定地回答他可以接受三个人一起的情事时，上齿将下唇咬出印子的模样，挑起的眉毛不由得扬得更高，指甲十分恶劣地将乳粒压得凹陷入原本颜色偏浅，这会儿却被揉弄得通红的乳晕里。  范丞丞被操弄得无力地搭住他的手，原本打算拨开的动作也在快感中变了味道，指尖疲软地蜷在他颜色深一个色号的手腕上，身体颠簸地似在迎合玩弄自己胸膛的大手。 这让他脸上因为快感的靡丽都变得隐忍而充斥着羞意，眼角红得像是还不断渗着水光。  陈立农不动声色地扫过他被自己咬得泛白的嘴唇，在镜片后显得模糊不清的眼睛微微眯起，将手指探进他紧咬的唇齿间。 在对方受惊的神色里逗弄起承受着快感的男人无措的舌尖。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Tony and Gibbs were sitting on Gibbs' couch and drinking beer.   “Boss?”  “Yes?”    “I have to tell you something very important.”  “Tell me, Tony.”  “I wanna ... fuck you.”  Gibbs raised his eyebrows. “You wanna fuck your boss?”  “Yes, I wanna fuck my boss.”  “And where you wanna do this?”  “Here. On the couch.”  “You wanna fuck me here on the couch?” Now Gibbs began to smile.  “Yes, I wanna fuck you here on the couch.”  “Now?”  “Now,” Tony answered in a rough voice.  “Do you wanna kiss me while you're fucking me?”  “Yes, I'll kiss you a lot of times.”  “Okay, that sounds good. And what will you do after fucking me?” Gibbs moved closer to him.  “After fucking you, I will hold you in my arms and cuddle with you.”  “That sounds really good.” Gibbs bent over and pressed a little kiss on Tony's lips. “I love you.”  “I love you too, darling.”   They would have sex on the couch and after that they would cuddle on it. It wasn't just Gibbs' couch. It was their couch. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*乔一帆住的地方是微草安排的，在一个高档别墅区的最里面，清净得很，平时只有迷路的外卖员会绕到他家门前。他开车从兴欣回来，正赶上暮色深浓而路灯未明的时分，穹窿阴沉，车前灯在地上泼出一片将就的光亮。他心不在焉，有些头疼，竟还恍惚从新的信息素中捉摸到一阵高英杰的柔情蜜意——很特别又熟悉的味道。 拐过转角就到家了，他盘算着如果遇见微草的人自己要如何解释行踪，还没捋出一套说辞就被路中间站着的人吓得踩了刹车。 高英杰裹在风衣里，踩着一地夕光，站在他家门口，等他。 胆大包天。 乔一帆一个激灵，推开车门就要赶人，可眼看高英杰大步流星地朝他走来，仓促酝酿出来的底气一瞬间垮了。他捂着自己后颈，徒劳地想要遮住被标记的气味，不易察觉地退后了一步，小声问：“你怎么来了？” 高英杰笑了一下，一把将人搂进怀里，放肆地与他咬耳朵：“我想你，就来了。”然后便拉拉扯扯推着他到了后车座上。 这展开似曾相识，他惊惶地瞪大了眼想要推拒——怎么能在这里做爱，万一被发现他们会杀了英杰的！ 可是他使不上力气，被Alpha扑了个满怀。而翻云覆雨这么多次后，高英杰早已褪去了最初的青涩，解他腰带的动作十分娴熟，只不过和从容搭不上边，透着一股急切和兴奋。天气尚嫌料峭，高英杰在外头站了不知多久，手指冰得要命，他身上被摸过的每一寸都不由得颤栗起来。腿根被冰凉的手掌掐住，后面那里却给那么热一根顶开了。 乔一帆也顾不上什么坚持立场一刀两断了，趁自己尚未沉沦情潮，小声哀求道：“不行，在这儿太危险了，英杰听话，我改天……改天和你去开房，你快出来！” 高英杰埋首在他颈窝，深深吸了口气，轻轻眨了下眼，他被颤动的睫毛扫得痒酥酥的，听到他呢喃了一句：“一帆被标记了呢。” 他又开始眼眶发酸，而高英杰又撒娇道：“昨晚你醉得厉害，都没好好看着我。本来想今天等你醒了就说明白，可是我才出去了一会儿，回来一帆就不见了。” 乔一帆愣了，像是不能理解他的意思，惊疑地重复：“昨晚？” “昨晚……”高英杰有些害羞地抱紧他，“昨晚我标记了你呀？是不是太凶了，对不起……” 高英杰把那一根完全埋进他身体里，不急着动，仿佛只要确认他不会离开就满足了一般：“我之前应该说过我也结了婚的？不是故意要耍你，我昨晚才知道自己到底娶了谁……一开始我想谈好离婚的事专心追你，所以才到这儿来，可是一来就看见你醉得一塌糊涂还在发情……” 这下乔一帆彻底懂了，啼笑皆非。当初他睡了高英杰还偷偷得意，现在回想起来，跟自己老公搞上了有什么好得意的？！至于叶队，大概也因为猜出了来龙去脉，彻底放弃了让他搞垮微草的计划。 想到叶修曾经透露的消息，乔一帆欲言又止，有意追问微草当下的情形，只是不知如何开口，再说现在这个情形怎么看也不适合扫兴—— 乔一帆轻而易举地就察觉到了高英杰的兴奋。 伏在他身上的Alpha一边缠绵地落下一个个凌乱的吻（甚至有的没有稳稳落到嘴唇而磕到了鼻尖），一边隔着他的衣物揉捏着他的胸前。他进出的动作并不如昨晚那般凶狠，反而细致又缱绻，似乎这样才能表达他的喜悦。 高英杰最后挺进生殖腔的时候又含住他的嘴唇，含含糊糊地跟他撒娇：“一帆……一帆……你知道我有多开心吗……再像昨晚那样叫叫我？” 这太羞耻了，乔一帆才不肯。他小幅度地推了一把高英杰，喘息着说：“你想什么呢……” “唔……”高英杰叹息一声，一个顶弄释放了出来。缓过余韵，他拉过乔一帆的手，轻轻地把他手上那枚丑得感天动地的婚戒拿了下来。 “哎……！你做什么！”乔一帆低低地惊呼。 “这个不好看，”高英杰在黑暗中朝他笑了笑，又亲了亲他的额头，说，“以后带你去挑个更好的。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~**多人车 cp洁癖误入  *带弟弟领略成人的混乱世界 *这次不带咻辉玩   现在坤音都不爱吃东西了吗？ 李英超看着到了晚饭时间依旧空空荡荡没有人影的餐桌，疑惑的挠了挠脑袋。 岳明辉出去了，但李振洋和卜凡是在家的啊。 他喊了几声，没人理他。 小弟在坤音也不受保护了。 他苦恼的捋了捋自己的刘海，走上楼打算去亲自喊两位懒哥哥下楼吃饭。 二楼的的地板还没迈上，李英超就听见掩得严严实实的房门里传来喘息和言语的窸窣声。 "嘶……卜凡你他妈的轻点，疼知不知道……" "你放松……腿张开……乖……对……" 这俩人又在干什么少儿不宜的事情？ 李英超不是不知道三个哥哥的事情，偶尔半夜从岳明辉或者李振洋房间传来的呻吟声总会把他从睡梦中惊醒，然后发现自己的下体硬的不像样子。 他试图过加入他们，可紧锁的房门和哥哥们语焉不详的含糊却将他拒之门外。 "嗨，小孩子……"岳明辉曾欲言又止的冲他笑了一下，摸了摸他的脑袋，"算了吧，超儿，嗯？" 他才不要算了！ 李英超站在门外想象着房间里李振洋躺在床上两腿张开，后穴艰难的吞着塑胶的性爱玩具或者又是卜凡修长的手指，分泌出来的肠液滴滴答答的打湿了一起买的床单，不禁失了神。 性欲像火一般从下体蹿到大脑。 所有的理智被清空，他鼓足勇气伸手去拧门把，成人的世界缓缓向他洞开—— 卜凡和李振洋忘了锁门。 床上的风景足以让他今生都难以忘怀。 李振洋的后穴含着的不是玩具也不是手指，而是卜凡货真价实的性器，因为过于粗长而暴露在外的大半截柱身正缓缓的被柔软的穴肉吞入。 李振洋的眼角泛红，含了媚人的春意，一丝不挂的身体上满是色情的吻痕，有的稍微浅一点，像是昨天晚上还没褪下去的，胸前的两点早就被玩弄得红肿不堪，而卜凡的手指还在上面流连着。 听到声响，两人同时看向门口，见到呆在了原地的李英超，也不着急，一点也没有做爱被人撞破的羞耻感，卜凡看了看犹犹豫豫的李英超，笑了笑，低下头继续在李振洋身上留下属于自己的印记。 李振洋无奈的推了推他，奈何人形哈士奇岂是他能推动的，只好由着他，抬了抬臀让性器进的更深，一边冲李英超轻笑："没看见你哥哥们在干事儿嘛，快出去，把门关了。" "干什么事儿。"卜凡握着他的腰一个顶弄，李振洋立刻软成了一滩水，只有在床上呻吟的劲儿，"干你啊。" 可能是这幅老把他当小孩子看的语气惹闹了李英超，他反手把门摔上，跨了两步到了床边，低头吻上了李振洋。 门发出一声寿终正寝的巨响，把李振洋和卜凡都吓了一跳，李振洋的后穴下意识的绞紧了卜凡的性器，差点没让他泄出来。 李振洋的唇舌被李英超狠狠掠夺，舌尖带着怒意掰开牙关，生气的舔舐过每一颗牙齿和每一寸软肉，最后与他的舌头交缠，传递着情欲和爱意的信号。 "呜……"他不禁发出了一声呜咽，未成年人的吻技出乎他的意料，不是敷衍就能过去的，只好仰头回应着李英超，来不及吞咽的津液顺着嘴角滴落，显得淫荡无比。 卜凡无暇去顾及李英超，不满的用力揉了揉李振洋柔软的臀瓣示意他不要咬的这么紧，直到上面留下手指的红印才松手，警告似的又拍了拍，重新撞击起来。 后穴中销魂的快感搭配着唇舌缠绵的温柔，李振洋爽得快要失去自己，撑着最后一点哥哥的尊严，他伸出两根手指捏住李英超的下巴，泛着情欲的目光直直照进他的眼睛，带着邀请的意味。 "Wanna join my party? " 答案毫无疑问是肯定的，只不过李英超给出的方式是再一次热烈而激动的亲吻，而李振洋也配合的伸出舌头引导着这个未成年人一步步迈向成人的世界。 这不是老岳的台词吗？ 被冷落的卜凡觉得委屈，停了身下的动作伸手想把李英超拽回来，到了半空又舍不得，最后不满的拍了一下李英超的屁股。 "好了，快把你洋哥松开，哥哥们给你上生理卫生课。" 李英超听话的结束了和李振洋的亲吻，像个好奇宝宝一样坐到卜凡身边看着两人结合的部位——李振洋的穴口微微泛红，粉嫩的媚肉包裹着青筋毕露的性器显得色情无比，让人不由自主的想象其中的销魂滋味。 李英超惊讶又好奇的眼神看的卜凡有点好笑，可荤话对着李英超那张纯洁如天使般的脸还是说不出口，卜凡暗暗懊恼自己的心软，索性把这股莫名其妙的感觉全部发泄在李振洋身上，性器的顶端在敏感点来回搅弄，肠液在身体的撞击中发出黏腻的水声，混合着李振洋毫不遮掩的呻吟呜咽。 "嗯…凡子你慢点……啊……慢……" 如此勾人的场景李英超早已硬的不行，扯下裤子毫无章法的抚慰着自己的性器，渴望着能获得更多的快感——手却被卜凡握住了。 "让你洋哥帮你啊，他还有一张嘴空着呢。" "就你话多……" 李振洋抱怨了一句，喘了喘，还是听话的张开嘴巴把李英超的性器顶端含入口腔—— 这不是李英超这种未成年人所能承受的快感。 口腔炽热的温度刺激着器官上敏感的神经，李振洋灵活的舌头在顶端打着转，偶尔深深的吮吸一口，手还富有技巧的去按摩后面的囊袋。 "洋哥……啊……嗯……" 抬眼看了看陷入情欲的李英超，李振洋笑了笑，张口给初经人事的小孩子来了个只有卜凡和岳明辉享受过的待遇——深喉。 喉管的紧致所带来的快感让李英超立刻缴械在李振洋口中，根本无法控制自己，前所未有的快感让他的大脑一片空白——于是也没有意识到他的洋哥把东西全部咽了下去。 李振洋也不好受，深喉带来的反胃让他的眼睛蒙上了一层水雾，反而显得更加勾人，卜凡安抚性的亲了亲他的眼角，性器也体贴的埋在他体内没有移动，反倒是李英超因为刺激而过快的高潮，半是爽快半是羞耻的掉了眼泪，于是卜凡又把未成年人搂在怀里，细细亲吻安慰。 "这就爽哭啦？"他笑着舔了舔李英超的耳垂，"后面还有更爽的呢。" *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“欧阳……”  “嗯？”  “放手……”  “不要。”  “放手。”  “不！”  欧阳叼着棒棒糖转头看看高述，理直气壮：“我牵我男朋友的手有错吗！”  高述不想否认，欧阳这句话他很受用。于是在那一瞬间，高述觉得什么都可以被原谅，包括欧阳吃完烧烤后又来牵他的手。  “你看，”欧阳握着他的手举到两人面前，慢慢地十指相扣，“这没什么。”  虽然吃完烧烤之后擦过手，但高述还是能感觉到那一份油腻，他知道这多是自己的心理作用。在最开始的时候他的确是受不了，但之后他又觉得这尚可接受。就在欧阳说完那句“男朋友”之后，一切的难以接受似乎都被允许。     高述从未想过自己真的会和欧阳在一起，当初喜欢欧阳的时候他就已经做好了分别的准备。于是高述也没有想过，欧阳谈恋爱的样子。不论是和他的还是和别人的。  但是现在，他不用想象，只需要抬头，就能收到一个爱意满满的笑容。  两个人在一起之后和以前并没有什么区别，最多就是高述可以毫无顾忌地将他的占有欲完全地在欧阳面前表现出来。  不过渐渐地高述发现欧阳很喜欢做一些亲昵的小动作。欧阳很喜欢肢体接触，比起直接地接吻，他会更喜欢牵手，但是似乎亲吻额头的好感度更高一些。  他们两个人的恋爱注定不可能在大庭广众之下亲亲抱抱举高高，而且他们也不是那种性格的人，不过小小的亲昵在恋人之间总是受欢迎的。  之前出国原本是想让自己习惯没有欧阳的生活，但最后却不得不承认这一点用处也没有，而且后来两个人在一起，相隔一个太平洋的距离简直让他抓狂。  两个人很难凑出一个完整的时间来相处，难得凑出来共同的假期是在春节前。他和欧阳提前了几天回国，在北京歇下来，勉勉强强拥有了三天二人时光。  这三天里他们大部分时间都待在了酒店里，仿佛是他们两个人的小家，来自现实的担心和不安都被挡在了门外，门一关，他们就和快乐拥抱了。  俩人就窝在房间里的小沙发上打游戏。  高述以前对游戏并不热衷，只是一个打发时间的消遣而已，认识欧阳后才慢慢地开始了解，但到现在也谈不上多喜欢，一切也只是因为欧阳喜欢。  奈何今天游戏之神似乎也忙着过年，也顾不上眷顾欧阳了，两人连着几局游戏都直接出局，算不上落地成盒，但也不像样子。  真是输的连男朋友都怀疑。  欧阳气得脸都红了，靠着高述一脸的难以置信。不过在游戏上欧阳从来就没认输过，恍惚了半分钟后又重新拉着高述一起回了战场。  这一下是重回巅峰了，两个人在地图里大杀特杀，把对手削得亲妈都不认识，于是欧阳终于舒心了。  和喜欢的人虚度光阴总是快乐的，等欧阳从电脑前挪开视线时，外面早就是灯火通明了。  吃过晚饭后两个人就躺床上开始看电影。影片是不久前的一部爱情片，他和高述说这是之前上映的时候有位姑娘推给他的。以往欧阳对爱情片向来是敬谢不敏，但现在他总是想和高述做一些情侣间的事，牵手，接吻，想念对方，也不差一起看傻得冒泡的电影。  但事实证明即使是谈恋爱也不能改变他对电影的偏好，虽然曾经引起一串鸡皮疙瘩的台词在当下也勉强能生出一份感同身受，但是该是傻得冒泡的地方一个也没少。  不过尽管如此两个人也没动手换片子，毕竟到了后来情到浓时满心满眼都是面前的这个人，谁也没有那份闲心再去管影片里的女主角是不是爱上了男闺蜜。  两个青年血气方刚，满满的一腔爱意不是一句简单的“我爱你”能够表达清楚的。  从亲吻开始，接下来的一切都如同喝水吃饭一样自然。  高述的吻有些急切，他含着欧阳的唇，舌头闯进欧阳的口腔，在其中肆意横行。  欧阳乖顺地躺在床上任由高述动作，双手环住高述脖颈，右手不停地揉着他的头发，似安抚又像催促。  他硬了。  高述拉开欧阳的裤链，隔着内裤搓揉几下他的性器，愈发高昂的欲望吐出的清液晕出了一块痕迹。  高述细细舔去欧阳下巴上流下的津液，一点也没有之前那个嫌东嫌西的洁癖狂魔的样子。  欧阳顺着高述的亲吻抬起头，将自己的脖颈完全暴露在他的眼前，像只没有反抗力的猎物，右手却是一路滑下高述的身体，沿着裤子边缘进去，准确地握住他昂扬的欲望。  高述一只手护在欧阳的脑袋上，另一只手却又坏心思地隔着衣服在欧阳左乳上揉捏着，衣服面料在皮肤上摩擦带来了更多的快感，可是欧阳受不住，喘息着小声反抗高述也全当没听见。  电脑早就被推到一边，但凡他们的动作再大一点就能直接掉下床去，但俩人谁也没去管。他们折腾到现在被子还是勉强地盖在身上，房间里开着暖气，刚才还舒适的温度现在却能蒸出一身的汗。  欧阳感觉自己的脑袋都快要热坏了。  高述握着两个人的性器摩擦着，欧阳整个下身几乎都是没有感觉的，唯独那一处迸发的快感让他全身发软。  欧阳的耳垂被高述含在嘴里，牙齿有时在上面研磨，那人粗重的喘息一直在耳边响起，欧阳后来不自觉地跟着他的节奏呼吸，仿佛离了他自己便无法呼吸。  两个人前后脚射出来，喷射出的白浊将他们的衣服染得一塌糊涂。欧阳重重地喘气，望着天花板放空自己，等缓过神后就向高述抱怨：“所以说你为什么你脱衣服啊。”  高述低头咬咬欧阳的下唇，小声问：“不舒服吗？”  ……那倒也不是不舒服。  于是欧阳又重新躺平了。   深夜，高述拥着欧阳躺在床上，脑袋凑近了他的颈窝，时不时在欧阳脖颈上落下一吻。欧阳没拒绝，只是迷糊地告诫他千万别留下印子。“上次拍照的时候没注意，差点叫小白发现。”她也就算了，但是万一回去的时候叫欧阳爸妈看见才是真的糟糕了。  高述没说什么，动作虽然如欧阳所愿放轻，双手却是将欧阳抱得更紧。欧阳只是动动换了更舒服的动作让高述抱着，之后两个人就都没有再说话了。  哪怕明天他们就要分开，又要相隔上一千八百二十九公里，各自面对冷酷的现实，但至少他们现在在一起，拥有了一段偷来的时光。     END. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*欧阳原本以为，和高述在一起会是他做过最出格的事情，但是现实一耳光甩到他脸上告诉他，这只不过是一个开始。  欧阳被高述抱着坐在椅子里亲吻，停下来的时候都有些迷糊。  “呜……老、老高……”虽然知道成功的希望不大，但欧阳还是想要阻止高述。毕竟……毕竟办公室play什么的实在是太羞耻了，即使现在已经是半夜了也不行！  高述不断地吻着欧阳的侧脸，想要安抚他不安的恋人：“乖，把一切都交给我。”语气极尽温柔，他的手却是不断地在揉弄着欧阳的臀瓣。  就是都交给你了才会出这种事啊！欧阳咬着唇瞪高述，眼角红红的，眼眶里还水盈盈的，让本来就没什么战斗力的欧阳威慑力更是减半。  在高述的眼中，就算欧阳真生气了，那也跟小奶猫挠爪似的。  高述从欧阳有些肉肉的脸颊一路吻到下巴，走过喉结时还伸出舌头微微用力向下压了压，欧阳没受住，几声颤抖的呻吟跑出来。  高述低头去咬欧阳胸前早就乖乖站立的两点，右手更是直接伸向欧阳的下身。  他的手不断的抚弄着欧阳的欲望，每一处都照顾得很好，极致的快感让欧阳无法拒绝，只能抱着高述的脑袋含糊地哭叫。  高述的技术真的很好，不只是手上的，包括嘴巴。欧阳觉得除了温度，高述的舌头和蛇也没什么两样了。胸前的舔弄就没有停过，阴茎处的抚弄更是细致，深怕欧阳不舒服。  高述的手灵巧地套弄着欧阳的柱身，仔细地描摹过其上的经络，玩弄着两颗囊袋，指甲轻划过马眼的瞬间酥麻感传遍全身，让欧阳立刻软了腰。  高述轻咬着欧阳胸前樱红的一点，牙齿恶趣味地慢慢磨动，手下的动作不停，两处的快感冲击得欧阳都要哭出来，弓着身子想要远离高述，却被他抱着腰揽住，两个人之前的距离比之前更近了一点。  这样也让欧阳更加真切地感受到了高述的炽热。今夜的高述，似乎比平时要更兴奋。  不久之后，欧阳尖叫着射在了高述手上。他靠在高述颈窝，快速地呼吸，像一条濒死的鱼。高述拿纸擦了手上的白浊，不再有下一步动作，只是静静地抱着欧阳，不断地亲吻他以示安抚。  欧阳没抬头，只是抓住了他的手腕，小声说：“你不进来吗？”反正都到这一步了，也不怕到最后。  高述在他耳边轻笑，眼睛亮亮的：“这算是在求欢吗？”     “………………算。”  饶是作为恋人的高述也没想到欧阳会这么说，听到的时候也不免心动。既然恋人有这个要求，他就不好不答应。  高述先将他放到办公桌上，然后到旁边柜子里找润滑剂。这个男人怕是想做这事很久了。  欧阳身上还勉强挂着件衬衫，感受办公桌上冰凉的温度的时候他条件反射的瑟缩了一下，结果高述的手就趁着这时候进去了。  “痛……”欧阳叫起来，抱着高述的脖子忿忿地去咬他肩膀。  高述纵着他动作，手上只管往更深处探索。  高述仔细地抚平后穴的每一处褶皱，不断在欧阳的敏感处戳弄，脸上的表情却是认真得像在做科学研究。欧阳看不惯他这假正经的样子，换着地方的咬他。  高述不阻止他，却在欧阳咬上自己脖子的时候说：“明天我可还要开会呢。”  欧阳只好收回来瞪他，最后啃上高述嘴唇。他含糊着说：“那我明天还要上班呢……”  怎么也没见高总裁留印子的时候有点顾忌！  高述伸出舌头与他的共舞，舌尖划过欧阳的上颚，舔舐欧阳口腔的每一处，与他共享着津液。  两人鼻尖抵着鼻尖，高述望着他的眼睛笑：“那我给你带薪假好不好？”     即使已经用了润滑，也做了扩张，但高述进去的时候还是有些困难。欧阳绷紧了身体，大腿根不停地颤抖。  “你……你慢一点……”欧阳抱着高述在他耳边低喘，软软地求他。  “嗯。”高述啃咬着欧阳的锁骨低声答应，下身却是截然不同地疯狂律动起来。  欧阳几乎是瞬间就叫出来，高述每一下都又重又深，而且都刚好顶到了他的那一点，真是要了命。  也许是环境的原因，即使知道现在这一楼里除了他们没有其他人但欧阳还是不敢放肆地叫喊出来。  但偏不巧，高述就喜欢在性事中听见欧阳的声音。  高述喜欢很多东西，都是关于欧阳的。  “欧阳……”高述含含着欧阳软软的耳垂低声说，带上情欲的声音低哑性感，“叫出来，没关系的。”  欧阳摇头，想要将高述推得远些来减轻这几乎要让他窒息的快感，双手最后却只能无力地搭在高述肩膀。  欧阳偏过头，盛在眼眶里的一汪水终于倾倒出来。高述爱怜地吻去他脸上的泪，身下却因此攻势更加猛烈起来。  “啊……”  高述的每一次进攻都引起欧阳一阵痉挛，到最后欧阳的双腿已经无力在勾住他。高述便撑起欧阳的腿，在他的大腿内侧吮吸，留下深红的印记。  快感冲上脑袋的同时还有些痛楚，却是如同催情剂一般的效果。欧阳的阳具早就又硬起了，被高述操弄着要迎来第二次高潮。  高述在欧阳脖颈处吮吸，感受到欧阳收紧了小腹，也知道他要高潮了，伸手去握住欧阳的性器，在他耳边哄他。  “乖……欧阳。”  “宝宝，再等一会儿……”  “宝宝……”  “我爱你。”     出办公室的时候欧阳两只腿都在颤抖，腿根处又酸又痛，刚沾地时两脚酸软无力，整个人不受控制的向前扑去。因此虽然欧阳极力反对，但还是没能阻止高述把他抱出去。  “我以后，再也不相信你了……再也不相信你了……”  高述轻笑，低头去吻欧阳的额头，没理恋人这种置气的话。     End. *~*TEXT*~*

Archer grimaced when the other man had the audacity to lean over even further and gasp directly into his ear.   “Watch yourself,” he snapped, smacking a broad hand that was unsubtly snaking its way towards his fly. “Even for you, acting this much like a dog in heat is unusual.”   “Sorry,” Lancer grunted, filling the shell of Archer’s ear with the rumbling sound. Cloth rustled and leather pants squeaked as the other servant grinded down on Archer - hard.   “Just...fuck...the way you spiked that volleyball into the lad’s face. That blatant self-hate and bitchy pettiness...left me feeling kinda hot.”  “You got turned on by me smashing in some kid’s face with a volleyball,” said Archer. “That’s fucked up but also kinda sexy.”   Then they banged. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Benny, please tell me-”  You cut off as he chuckled, holding up the handcuffs higher for you to see them.   “Come on.” he chuckled, reaching out and pulling you closer to him. “You always told me you wanted to experience different things; keep things exciting.”  “Benny…” you felt your face growing warm as you looked over Benny’s shoulder and noticed Dean’s smug smirk as he leaned on the kitchen counter. You looked between your boyfriend and Dean. “Did you put him up to this?”  Dean chuckled. “Hey, I only suggested it.” he shrugged “He thought you would enjoy it.”  “Let’s go.” you pulled Benny’s arm towards Dean before grabbing the Winchester and dragging them both to your shared bedroom. “Hell hath mercy on whoever interrupts us in the next several hours.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Probably a bad idea. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~* Other dragons go and finds themselves a mate, but oh no, not mine. Mine has to go and be an idiot about things.  Arguably, of course, the bigger idiot was the guy volunteering to have a dragon cock stuffed up his ass. His own cock'd gone half-hard at the idea alone. Reality was better. None of his fantasies had included the sensation of the scales, the way it felt when the first egg was slowly pushed all the way inside, stretching him wide open to receive it then leaving him aching for the next one, and the one after that. *~*TEXT*~*

I am not scared, even though Talia's fingers fill me more completely than I ever dreamed, because I let her know this.  I let her know my body. She must know my mind, shielded though we are, because her fingers work me higher so perfectly, thrust and curl and stroke and  again .  She is with me in the most important ways, and I am burning under her hands. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Conrad takes advantage of a situation at hand. Or in hand, as the case may be. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The palm of Kong's hand felt like perfection against Conrad's naked body: rough enough to give him some delicious friction, but softer and warmer than he'd expected.  Given time, Conrad wondered if he might come from this sensation alone - something to try another time, perhaps. He had no idea whether Kong was even aware of what was happening, of what Kong's reaction might be if he caught on to Conrad being -  Kong snorted, staring down at him.  Conrad looked back, one hand reaching for his cock, already feeling far too close to last more than a few minutes, if that. *~*TEXT*~*

"Whatever did those ninnies teach my little princess?" I whisper as my tentacles brush across her skin.   She cries out, of course, but that is easily taken care of when my tentacles fill her mouth as thoroughly as they fill her womanhood.   Later, she is surprised when her stomach starts to grow.   Poor, silly Aurora.   Imagine being a princess and not knowing that your duty is to bear an heir. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*你愣住，下意识地回问他：“什么？”   康纳歪了歪头，你这时候才发现房间的灯不知道什么时候打开了，灯光照过来，在他高挺的鼻梁侧打下一小片阴影。    “只要你同意。”   他的手轻轻往下移，顺着你裙摆一路摸进，直到隔着内裤碰上你的肉缝——   你慌张起来：“康纳！”   只是轻轻一碰，甚至像是羽毛一般地刮过，你还没有反应过来，他的手已经收了回去。   下一秒，他伸舌，舔了舔指尖。   该怎么说那场景呢？   只探出些许舌，你只能看到那舌尖微微压在齿上，指尖贴住他稍有些薄的下唇一点，给他那张禁欲而英俊的脸添上些许色气。   不自知的诱惑。   康纳放下手，定定看你歪着脖子望他。   你马上意识到自己盯着他干了什么，脸刷地烧起来。   他怎么可以舔？！   还是那么色情地舔！    “这样会让你舒服吗？”   依然是那把不带任何感情的嗓音，与之截然不同的是康纳再次袭过来的手，带着体温的指腹柔软，连带着动作也轻柔。   衣摆被撩起，他一点一点地顺着你的脊椎上移，在碰到内衣的边缘时停下手来。    你被他摸得身子发软，在感受到他的小指一勾，内衣突然一松的时候整个人怔愣住——   康纳……   在干什么？   仿生人……可以进行性爱吗？   修长的手指自后绕过来，握住你的乳，他的动作说不起来的别扭，甚至是僵硬的，毫无章法地揉捏乳肉，又在听到你狠狠吸了一口气时，顺着胸乳的尖端一捏——   “嗯……”   你抑制不住地叫出声，在意识到自己的呻吟后羞赧地将头埋在了沙发。康纳没有吭声，也许是你的那声呻吟被分析为带有“愉悦”色彩的一声浪叫，他的腿挤进你的双腿之间，手仍然在胸乳上游动着。   当康纳的手指挤进花穴时，你整个人都忍不住战栗了起来。  甚至可以清晰地感受到他的指腹轻轻蹭在肉壁上，慢慢地扩张开甬道。   “小姐，请放松点。”他的腔调一成不变，你却可以从这语气里听出一丝调情的意味。你知道有部分仿生人是被设定为“床伴”，因而关于床事技巧的程序也会被设定进去，但你现在才知道……   康纳也会这些。    “康纳，”你听到自己带着喘息的嗓音，在他撩了一手情液的时候响起：“你可以进行性交吗？”    “是的，小姐。”    冰冷，机械。    “好，就那样。”你抖着嗓子说道，突然想起今天穿的内衣裤似乎不是一套，正要开口叫他改天，他的手指却已经退了出去，下一秒，你整个人被他翻过身子，双腿大开向着他。   康纳扯了扯领带，俯下身子。   “是的，小姐。”   你不知道他为什么要重复说两遍，但你清楚地看到，康纳一侧的嘴角轻轻地往上翘了翘。    康纳进来的时候，你脑海里首先想到的竟然是仿生人的男根原来是这么的……长。   将甬道都塞满了一般。   他直直地挺进来，男性的根部与你的嵌合，连睾丸也轻轻拍在臀部的肌肤上，夹杂着他抽插进入花穴的水声，在静谧的房间里格外清晰。   “您的阴道，”他的声音如古井无波：“很紧，像小口一样咬着我。”   浑身的血都冲上了脑袋一样，你的脸刷得变得通红，偏生他还要往深处顶，抽插的速度也断断续续地加快起来，像是要将你拆开入腹一般。你喘着开口：“闭……”   “小姐的乳房颜色也很好看，”康纳没有停下嘴的意思，也许设计者认为在性爱中加入荤话是一样助兴的功能，但你此刻只觉得自己像是剥光了被人由头到尾盯着看一般——即使现在的你离剥光并不远。   “是粉……”   你忍无可忍，在他冲撞进来的时候扯着嗓子：“闭嘴康纳！”    他歪着头看你，也许是在分析你这句话的意思。    “我明白了，小姐，”你从未有一刻像此刻这样想冲起来捂住康纳的嘴，“享受性爱是第一要义。”   他握住你的膝盖往上推，这个姿势让你整个人都靠进了沙发，也让花穴完全裸露了出来。   康纳的顶端硕大炙热，混着滑腻淋漓的花液，顶开花唇，一插到底——   “嗯……”    “如果要挑选床伴，显而易见的，我是最优秀的，   “那些男人，只会粗鲁地伤害您，而我，没有人会比我更疼爱您，我甚至还会通过分析您在性事上的表情来获得信息，从而让您更愉悦，   “不是吗，我的小姐？” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Bella and Frank are teachers. Tantric potential is what they claim to teach. Energy flows towards their harmonious Queen. Ecstasy is the way to server her, moving bodies working towards pleasure and her satisfaction.   John's new among them.  He takes to their teaching immediately.  They share him, take their turns with him. He gives and submits as easily as he takes and grasps and wants.  In a culmination of orgasm, the room full of moans as they're watched by the learners, the Queen is gone with a screech. The spells is broken.  "Harmonious Queen, my ass," John mumbles, extracts himself. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Thor’s skin prickles as Heimdall circles him, inspecting. Surveying. He peers behind Thor’s ear. A touch brushes back the hairs at Thor’s nape. Fingers trace the join of his neck and shoulder, then down, down past ribs to settle on his hip, then farther still to Thor's cock, standing thick and expectant. A thumb sweeps across the tip. Thor twitches, minute. "Tell me what you see, Far-Seer." Heimdall turns golden eyes to him, so warm; shakes his head. "Tonight, I see you up close." "Look closer still," Thor says, hoarse. "I'll show you anything. Everything." "Yes," Heimdall breathes. "Show me." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Prologue People disappear all the time. Young girls run away from home. Children stray from their parents and are never seen again. Housewives take the grocery money, and a taxi to the train station. Most are found eventually. Disappearances, after all, have explanations. Usually. Strange, the things you remember. Single images and feelings that stay with you down through the years. Like the moment I realized I'd never owned a vase. That I'd never lived any place long enough to justify having such a simple thing. And how at that moment, I wanted nothing so much in all the world as to have a vase of my very own. It was a Tuesday afternoon. Six months after the end of the war. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*There laid a beautiful girl, one the dark haired woman took immense pleasure of killing. Killing is such an ugly word, ending one’s life by another hand. But the women crept closer. Wiping her drool away and she put her knife into the dead lady, tearing off a chunk of flesh and Violet feeds herself again. Violet’s hand creeps down the woman’s abdomen, to her pelvic area and down to her. . .oh. That area is still warm. Violet crawls over, spreading the woman’s legs and spreading her lips apart. She craved it, she was basically a dog crawling and whining at the front door, begging to be unleashed. Her lust for the woman driving her to the brim of insanity, Violet puts her one of her legs on the other side of the woman and begins to move herself. She pants, moans, feeling, hearing her wetness slap against the other woman. She loves it, feeling the warmth of a live person slips between her fingers, her knife and her lips. Such a lovely feeling. A feeling she wants more of. *~*TEXT*~*

A moment later, he received a blushing emoji.  I’m out with Steve, babe….   Thor smirked and sent a picture of the towel wrapped around his waist as he laid out on the bed:  I miss you, James. Come home to me soon.   He could picture his boyfriend biting hard on his lip to conceal the heat he felt between his legs. I’m with Steve, babe.  Smirking proudly, Thor pulled the towel away from his front and snapped the photo before sending it to Bucky.  I’ll be home in ten minutes. *~*TEXT*~*

Steve kisses him then, bending him back over the conference room table, when Tony tries to wriggle free. The kiss deepens and it's not all Steve.  The sex is fast. Steve holds him down the whole time.  "Alright, I'll stay." Tony huffs.  "Good." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Arthit双手被绳子牢牢的绑在床头，像绸缎一样细滑白嫩的身体赤裸的陷在柔软的大床，上面布满了些许的青紫和红痕，两条腿被最大限度的打开，红肿的菊穴毫无掩饰的暴露在了空气中，Kongphop的粗长的分身不停的在其中冲撞着，Arthit扭动着腰肢承受着他的进攻。 “啊～嗯～”支离破碎的声音从干裂的嘴唇中不断溢出，口中分泌的唾液溢了出来，顺着嘴角滑落至下颚，在灯光的照耀下形成一道银线。 “下次还逃不逃？嗯？”Kongphop一只手拽着Arthit白皙的脚踝，把想向床头躲避的他拽了回来，然后下半身依然疯狂的在小穴里顶弄着，不停的在他敏感的前列腺粗暴的翻捣着，另一手自然的就附在了Arthit的胸前，随意的拨弄着夹在他肿胀的乳头上的乳夹，小巧的夹子上绑着小幅度震动的跳蛋，在充斥着淫靡气息的空间里“嗡嗡”作响。 “啊～！”敏感的乳头被刺激的瞬间，Arthit的腰一下就从床上弹了起来，蹙着眉头，紧闭着双眼，咬着牙承受着这过激的快感。 他全身都紧绷着仰躺在床上阵阵颤抖，细密的电流仿佛传遍了四肢百骸，过激的快感刺激的他连脚趾都蜷缩了起来，他的大脑里就像出现了一道白光，所有的声音这时都被置身在了脑海之外，片刻后，他泄了出来。不知道发泄了几次的分身，缓缓地吐出一股股的白灼，沾湿了Arthit粉嫩的玉茎。 “呵，即使被这么粗暴的对待，还是依旧很喜欢不是吗？”Kongphop向前抬了抬腰，本来滑出来的阴茎又重新插到了底。 “唔...”Arthit无力的瘫软在床上，身下的床单早就被他的汗水和分泌出的体液洇湿了大片，早就被操干到松软的菊穴依然不知疲惫的吞吐着Kongphop的粗大。 “还逃不逃了？问你话呢。”Kongphop捏着Arthit下巴强行掰过了他的脸，白净的脸上一片狼藉，双瞳失焦的望着天花板，睫毛上还挂着几颗晶莹的泪珠。 “唔唔...”Kongphop又狠狠的操干了两下，才听到Arthit的嘴里再次传来细小的闷哼声，可是依然没有回答他。 Kongphop看着Arthit爱搭不理的态度有些恼火，他拔出了分身，探着身子伸手解开了绑着Arthit手腕麻绳，白嫩的手腕上被粗糙的绳子勒出了一道一道的红痕，Kongphop只是淡淡的瞥了一眼，便收起了心中生起的心疼。 然后他狠狠的揪着Arthit的头发把他从床上拽了起来，强迫早已神智不清的他跪坐在了床上，随后就握着自己沾满了肠液的分身，架在了Arthit的艳红的嘴唇上，然后左右摩挲着，把Arthit自己分泌出的肠液均匀的涂在了他的唇瓣上，亮晶晶的粘液滋润了他干裂的唇瓣。 Kongphop一只手捏住了Arthit的下巴，手上的压力迫使他张开了嘴，Kongphop也没有再犹豫，而是直直的就把粗长的分身送入他的空中，湿热的口腔包裹着他的分身，他满足的叹息了一声便慢慢的在这小口里抽送起来。 “唔唔...”一股腥咸的味道在自己的口腔中蔓延开，来不及咽下的唾液全部流了出来，然后滴落在了床单上，Kongphop拽着他的头发强迫他抬起头，更加方便着自己的抽插的动作。 Arthit的喉咙收缩着想努力吞咽着自己分泌出的唾液，舌头也随之微微动了动，却不小心刮弄到了Kongphop分身上凸起的青筋，他浑身抖了一下便不敢再乱动了。 “Arthit你的小舌好软。”Kongphop勾了下嘴角调笑到，随后就加快了抽送的速度似乎是想让他舔弄更多，可是Arthit却怎样都不肯再就范了，一直偏着头躲闪着。 Kongphop用手固定住了他的下巴又狠狠的顶一下，“再张大点，你的牙齿碰到我了。”Arthit木讷着半张着嘴，下巴有些酸涩导致下颚都有些颤动。被动的吞吐着Kongphop的粗大，他的双眼有些失神，眼眶有些红红的，生理性的眼泪顺着眼角流出，在脸颊上留下一道水痕。 Kongphop又深顶了一记，硕大的阴茎直直的捅入他的喉咙深处，惹得Arthit一阵干呕，嗓子随之也蠕动着挤压着龟头，让Kongphop舒爽的闷哼一声， “嗯哼～Arthit你可真厉害。” Arthit的口中溢满了腥咸味混杂着唾液，而口中的巨物还不断的在顶弄着他喉咙的深处，而他却因为这诡异的快感勃起了。已经疲惫不堪的下身又悄然立了起来，却因为迟迟得不到爱抚，本来粉嫩的玉茎此时也染上了红色，他夹紧了双腿悄悄磨蹭着渴望着得到更多的快感。 Kongphop也发现了他身体的变化，不但没有理会转而又用手扶住了他的头顶，向下按了按他的头“来，专心点。” 看着跪在自己身下用嘴服侍他的Arthit，Kongphop的心中不禁升起一股满足感，这样的Arthit恰好满足了他的征服欲，他哼笑了一下，被迫抬起了Arthit的头，看着他空洞无神的眼睛，用戏谑的语言嘲弄道，“谁能想到你在道上混了这么多年，现在居然在我的床上，这么伺候我。” Arthit的身体登时僵住了，瞳孔也因为这句话恢复了片刻的清明，Kongphop的话就像一把锋利的刀子直直的刺进了他的心脏中，心如刀绞。 Kongphop并没有在意Arthit的感受，而是攥着他的头发又抽动了两下，分身在他的嘴里抖了抖，咸涩的白灼全数喷溅到了他的喉咙里，有些许顺着气管流了下去，突然而来的热浪把Arthit呛到清醒，他的肺像是要炸裂一般的无法呼吸，令他不得不趴跪在床上干咳，胸腔强烈的震动使他眼泪都涌了上来，Arthit微微昂首还能看到他嘴角挂着的几丝的精液，一副淫靡的媚态。 Kongphop冷清的声音从上飘进了他的耳朵。 “下次再逃跑可就不是这么简单了。” Arthit清如潭水的眼底涌现出了深深的绝望，他浑身无力的趴在了一片狼藉的床单上，胸膛起伏着慢慢喘息。 “呵...我还能逃到哪里去...”片刻后微弱的声音从Arthit有些嘶哑的喉咙里传出来，略带自嘲的语调像是在回答Kongphop，又似是在回答自己。 他的眼睛呆滞的看着落地窗外的夜景，此时窗外星星点点的灯光都映照进了他的眸子里，他的睫毛微微颤抖了两下，眼泪便不受控制的向外涌出，沾湿了身下的床单，从那氤氲着湿气的瞳孔里，依然可以看到初次相见时的那份倨傲，可是他的心却早已因为这段感情的洗礼而变得千疮百孔了...... ————— 或许他从没想到，自己竟有一天会落得这般不堪的境地，一想到这个男人对他所做的一切，心中就涌起了满腔的耻辱与不甘。如果他们不曾遇见，如果他们只是擦肩而过，如果他们不是对方。那么这一切会不会变得不一样，可这一切又岂能皆如人愿，命运的枷锁还是将他们牢牢的捆绑在了一起。 互相折磨，无法逃脱。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*男人从浴室里走出来，随意地解开了浴袍扔在地上，赤裸地走过来。他的身材完全配得上他那张脸，颀长匀称，肌肉健硕而不夸张，如果忽略掉大大小小的已经掉疤的伤痕，简直可以说得上是养眼，但也就是这些伤痕让男人身上更有了一种凛然的气质，带着aphla信息素辛辣的味道压向了孙翔。  莫非是上过战场的？孙翔想了一下，毫不示弱，眯起眼睛笑着吹了声口哨：“身材不错。”  “只是不错？”男人没有给孙翔回答的机会，直接压在了他身上，一边吮吸着omega柔软的嘴唇，然后沿着脖颈吻下去，一边直奔主题，往孙翔已经湿润的后穴里塞了半个指头，“这么紧，第一次？”  “你管我第几次？”孙翔挑挑眉毛，被男人在锁骨上啃了一口，忍耐不住也不想忍耐地呻吟了一声，“唔……”  “好好，我不管行了吧。”男人轻笑了一声，已经把整根手指伸进去搅动，在孙翔粉嫩的乳首上吮了一口，“叫得真浪，多叫几声来听。”  “啊哈……”乳头的敏感实在超出孙翔的想象，甚至他的声音也甜腻得要命。孙翔知道这是属于omega的本能在驱使着他的身体向aphla献媚讨好，却也并不在意。O天生就要比A弱势，何况眼前这个绝对是aphla中的aphla，孙翔都清楚，但从来不认为身体的本能代表着他内心的屈服。  他主动地张开了双腿，手向下伸向了男人的命根，那东西实在又大又烫，孙翔忍不住愣了一下，但这更激起了他的不服气，握住那东西认真地撸动起来。  男人猝不及防，也从嘴里发出低低的呻吟声，他颇感有趣地看着身下少年明亮的眼睛，觉得他和自己从前偶有的一二互相解决生理问题的对象确实不同。他从来没有见过这样的omega，主动热辣却又沉稳冷静，让他突然对自己被吐槽已久的审美目光有了自信。  哥这挑人不是挑得挺好的么。  孙翔的后穴已经足够湿软，男人撤出了三根湿嗒嗒的手指，抬头亲吻住他的嘴唇，孙翔也就配合地抬脚缠上了男人的腰。  尽管硬气如孙翔，第一次被那种大东西进入的时候还是差点疼到要哭出来，他有些不知所措地僵硬着身体，下意识地想要往回躲，却又咬着牙非要逼自己接着把aphla的性器吞下去。男人无奈地低笑着开口：“这么厉害还要aphla干什么？干脆自己和自己做吧。”他亲了亲孙翔湿润的眼角，“乖乖，放松身体，我慢慢来。”  孙翔低哼了一声，还是听了进去。男人带着信息素醉人的味道更深地亲吻着omega，手指也不闲着地四处点火，于是欲潮重新席卷了孙翔的身体，被疼痛镇住的欲望无法阻挡地复苏，男人安抚着孙翔立起来的性器，最后一挺腰顶到了最深处。  “唔！”孙翔眨了眨眼睛，眼里积蓄已久的潮湿化成水滴顺着太阳穴流下来。  这场性爱酣畅淋漓，AO的味道如此契合，孙翔当然做不到真地全程清醒，但对方一样做不到，到后来双目赤红，只知道抱着孙翔的腰一声声叫着“翔翔”把他的屁股撞得啪啪响。  临近高潮的时候，孙翔爽得昏了头，顺着男人不知道叫了哪些荤话，自己抱着腿根连连喊着操我，男人不满地一拍他的屁股：“谁在操你？”  “谁在操我……？”孙翔眼角发红，被男人撞得浑身打颤，只知道傻乎乎地重复对方的话，男人惩罚似的往omega穴里最要命的点上狠狠一撞，疯狂的快感让孙翔几乎叫都叫不出来，只听见男人恶狠狠在他耳边开口：“叶修，我的名字是叶修。”  “唔呃……是叶哥在操……”孙翔猛地再次失去了声音，睁大了漂亮的眼睛，和叶修一起冲上了巅峰。  孙翔第一次体会到AO相碰的可怕，被陌生的快感冲击得疲惫不堪，几乎很快就睡了去。单留下叶修摘了套子又给孙翔简单清理了一下，慢悠悠地坐在床头抽了一根烟，才躺回床上，在孙翔额头上亲了一口，抱着omega缓慢沉入了梦境。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Drabble:  "Uh Oh..."     One of his own people. Shocking!  "Show it to me" Captain Kirk said grimly.  The graffiti in the men's restroom was written in tiny, clearly printed letters in the grout area between two tiles above the center urinal. "Spock craves Kirk's cock" it declaimed.  "Here's another sir" the security officer said gently.  Sure enough, there was a similar message on the wall inside the end stall, over the paper dispenser.  "Spock wants to tongue-bathe Captain Kirk."  I want this handwriting analyzed!" Kirk exclaimed, outraged. "I want the perpetrator identified!"  "We have sir." The security officer said. "It's... Mr. Spock, sir." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Hello Dori Fes! fandom that is very tiny here on AO3.   I was sitting in my room rewatching the La La La Live Special online the other day and my brain suddenly thought up "There's not enough DFes fics out there. Plus like no one has your ships so who better to write a fanfic about W-MasKat than you??"  This is just a seedling idea right now but I would love some ideas and getting this fic off the ground. I'm willing to do crossovers but only if they work so I'd be willing to crossover with Idolish7 or UtaPri or some other idol animes.      Please show this fic to other fans on Facebook or Twitter or Discord and place a comment with ideas and prompts. I'd prefer to keep all the ships as Chizuru centric since he's my BB from DFes but I could do some small stuff about other ships if that's what I get a lot of requests for.     Thank you to whoever is reading this short asking for help fic.

*~*TEXT*~*Rusty is rank, the ripe smell of sweat and unwashed gear clinging to his skin even after Sid strips him out of his base layers. Sid can't get enough of it. He presses his face to Rusty's neck, flicking his tongue to taste the salt of his collar bones.  He grips Rusty's cock, thumbing the head before dropping to his knees. Rusty heaves deep, panting breaths while Sid works him over. He has one hand in Sid's hair, the other clenching and unclenching against nothing.  He comes with a shout. Sid pulls off and smiles against Rusty's belly, breathing deeply. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*They love each other...  But they hate each other too...  Sexual tensions and broken hearts collide in this passionate odyssey of self-esteem and regrets. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Their lips crashed together, burning, soaring. Mouth on mouth, saliva connecting, passion and hatred pouring out into each other. They kissed fervently, feverishly, without limits or remorse or regrets. Nothing mattered but each other, yet they hated each other too. It burned, it cooled, it flew and it fell. Love and hate, lust and disgust, maddened yet calm at the same time.  Oxymorons, metaphors, beautiful yet terrible poetry bounded back and forth between their clashing lips as they moaned into each other shamelessly. They would regret this soon, but not yet. Not yet. Everything was moving to fast yet not fast enough.   Then they broke apart, and looked at each other in identical fear, love and hatred.  He walked away nervously, a bit embarrassed that he ended up making out with the mirror again. *~*TEXT*~*

He fisted both hands in Tim’s shirt. “Need to dress you up too.”   Tim shivered under his words and touch and leaned in for a kiss.   He was so much easier to handle like this.  *~*TEXT*~*

Leske shrugged, before standing and strolling away.  “If you insist.”  Jenny rolled her eyes, before returning her gaze to the ground. It would be over soon. That was all that mattered. *~*TEXT*~*

She fought the urge to throw something as another man in a sweat-soaked t-shirt walked over.  “Hey, Baby. I-”  “Thank you. As much as I appreciate the offer, I already have a girlfriend.” Delilah snapped. She’d learnt by now that it was best to nip it in the bud.  “Really? How do you come?”  Delilah sighed, resisting the urge to yell at him for asking such a question.  “Normally, we walk.”  Even in Stardew Valley, she couldn’t escape idiots. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Most people would assume that Dean Winchester, all bow legs and muscle cars, was straight. He hid it well after all. Never once did his gay thoughts of his own little brother show on his face.  But Sam was tired of that. See, the two had been in a very active relationship for many months now, and Sam was yet to act out his deepest desire. Bending Dean over the hood of his beloved Impala and screwing him until the others living in the bunker were well versed with his name.  But for now, he was less interested since they now had Jack. And Dean hated every second that he was ignored in favor of Jack. The thought that he was being replaced danced in his mind more than once as he drove idly down nameless highways and interstates.  He even went so far as to ask Crowley for help, to which he laughed and directed him to Rowena. She was all gentle voiced about it and it made him  sick , throwing around words like ' anxiety ' and ' depression ' before finally explaining that Sam wasn't replacing Dean. He didn't believe her.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Khadgar, in Anduin Lothar’s estimation, had proven himself to be quite a talented mage. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Khadgar, in Anduin Lothar’s estimation, had proven himself to be quite a talented mage.   Since their initial meeting, the young man had demonstrated his great skill with magic time and time again.  Whether he was fighting a marauding band of orcs, defeating a Fel-possessed Guardian, or developing new and inventive spells that would aid their struggle against the Horde, Khadgar’s aptitude was unquestionable.  But he was no mere battlemage.  Oh no, not at all.  The new spell Khadgar had been working on made that clear.    It was a modified mirror image spell, similar to what Lothar had seen Medivh perform many times in the past.  But instead of copies that lasted for minutes, these had lifespans of nearly an hour, as long as they suffered no damage.  Which they wouldn’t, not here and not now.   Not with the real Khadgar rocking up and down on Lothar’s cock, while the two mirror images ran their hands and lips over the rest of the warrior’s body, stroking and caressing him as he and his mage chased their mutual ecstasy together. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Holmes had noticed how Watson stole glances at him in his white suit. It was time to transform glances to action. They were  finally  alone so he struck. Holmes allowed his cravat to trail sensuously through long fingers that Watson waxed poetic over. “Holmes?” Watson’s voice cracked and Holmes lifted an eyebrow, smiling. Shirt deposed Holmes stretched watching in satisfaction as Watson swallowed heavily. “Aren’t you going to examine me Watson?” Watson approached in a daze and once close Holmes seized his gentleman doctor and kissed him fiercely. Ah, he was going to like the feel of Watson’s moustache greatly. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“You have shouldered so many burdens for so long,” Valkyrie said.  “While you were shirking yours.” She flinched, then grinned. “So give me a turn. One hour.” “Very well,” Heimdall said, and he let her fix his wrists behind him.  He couldn’t tell whether it was an hour, or less, or more; whether he’d gasped or groaned or shouted; whether he’d spilled with her fingers around his cock, on his belly, or in his mouth. He had to trust her for that.  Finally her lips touched his forehead. “I give you your burdens back now,” she said, and released him. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*沈巍看出来了，赵云澜是个Omega。  Alpha的本能叫嚣着让他把这个男人摁在身下，咬上他脖后的腺体在他体内成结。  但他没有这样做。  他把赵云澜带回了自己的房间，高个男人俯在床榻上大口大口喘着气，身上有甜腻的香味散发出来，身下涨得鼓鼓囊囊，他只看了一眼就面红耳赤地别过头。  赵云澜感觉自己快疯了。  那杯酒里的药性很猛，且把他抑制了多年的发情期都一下激了出来，身后不用看也知道是水渍淋漓，这种陌生的情潮带来的耻辱感让他恨不得杀了自己。  手臂一凉，赵云澜将视线投过去。沈巍已经脱下了那身黑袍，衬衫西裤，工工整整地站在自己面前，担忧之色纠在眉头，浓得化不开。  赵云澜喜欢沈巍。  察觉到赵云澜的目光，沈巍松开手，像做错事一般抓了抓自己的衬衫下摆，犹犹豫豫：“我…我不知道怎么能让你好受一点…”  沈巍的信息素味道很好闻，是淡淡的松香味，此刻一个劲儿地往赵云澜鼻孔里钻。  一个念头在赵云澜心里成了形。  “沈巍。”赵云澜开口才发现自己声音哑得不像话，他拍了拍自己身边的床褥，“过来。”  沈巍听话地在他身边坐下。  赵云澜索性也不藏着掖着自己汹涌而出的欲望，脱了自己的衣服又扯开沈巍的衬衫，他身上很凉，肌肤相触时让他满足地喟叹了一声。沈巍好像被吓到了——不怪他，自己的动作着实猴急了点儿，好一会才慢慢反应过来，大手覆上他腰间的肌肤，细细地揉。  赵云澜的动作很快，在他白玉一般的胸膛上摸了两把就成功让沈巍动了欲念。他抽出沈巍的腰带，几下就把两人脱了个干干净净，伸手按住他的腰腹，试探着寻到那片滚烫，蹭了蹭就要坐下。  “云澜。”沈巍摘了眼镜，表情似忍似痛，“你会后悔。”  “我不后悔。”赵云澜探身吻上沈巍的唇瓣，“沈教授，救人一命，胜造七级浮屠。你就忍心看着我受苦吗？”  话音刚落，他猛地往下一压，撕裂的痛楚从身后传来，激得他出了一身冷汗，后穴深处却有什么东西被瞬间填满，层层叠叠的快感堆上来，很快就盖过了这一瞬间的裂痛。  赵云澜喘了口气，想要再动，腰间却被沈巍死死扣住。  男人恢复了长发，看起来明显更不好受，出口的话还是轻言细语，像是对待一件易碎的珍宝：“云澜，你这样会伤到自己的。”  “不会。”赵云澜扯出的笑带着那么点儿嘲讽，在他耳边轻声呢喃，“沈巍，你知道Omega是什么吗？”最后几个字他加重了语气，颇有几分不管不顾的狠劲儿，“Omega就是用来操的，越用力越好。”  沈巍叹了口气，温柔地将两人换了个位置，拉开赵云澜的双腿，一下一下地抽干着，嘴唇温柔地蹭了蹭他的脸颊。  “可我舍不得让你疼，一点儿都不行。”  “我不疼。”沈巍的动作很轻柔，硕大的冠首擦过内壁的敏感点，惹得赵云澜不由自主地吸了口气，再开口时带了点儿平时痞里痞气的味道，“沈教授，深藏不露啊，平时没少瞒着我健身吧？”  “你喜欢吗？”沈巍渐渐加快了动作，脸还是红的，“你喜欢…我就再多练练。”  “喜欢，怎么能不喜欢。”赵云澜眯了眯眼，看得出沈巍在强压着自己的欲望先让自己好受，索性将腿盘上他的腰，调戏般夹了夹。  “云澜。”沈巍停了动作，细密密的汗珠顺着额头滚落下来，眼里带上了几分委屈，“你这样我会忍不住。”  “那就别忍着。”赵云澜轻笑了一声。沈巍顿了顿，随即如开了弓一般不再克制自己的力气，滚烫的肉茎捅进身体最深处又抽出来，但生殖腔那片小小的入口还是完好的。  酥麻和酸痛层层堆积上来，赵云澜蜷了蜷脚趾，整个人浑身一激，有什么东西像是开了闸，洪水一般席卷而来。只本能地将想将身体绞紧，缩成一团。  沈巍狼狈地抽出自己的分身，白浊的液体在空中划出一道长长的弧线，两人都是第一次经历这种情事，一齐倒在床上平复着呼吸。  “黑袍哥哥。”赵云澜脸颊酡红，那双眼却晶晶亮亮，故意恶搞般拔高了声线，“你可要负责哟～”  “负责怎么够。”沈巍贴过来印上他的唇，“我把我的心都掏出来对你好，我保证。”     Fin *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The knife rests surely in his hands. The first time they did this it didn’t. Now he feels more secure in wielding it. There never was anything in Martin’s life that was in his control, not from his mother, his job - to the people he cares about. This, however, is.  For Tim it’s a way to distract himself. From his grief, from his anger, from the memories haunting him.  Martin traces the knife over Tim’s skin. Then he presses a bit harder and blood wells up, not much, but enough. Carefully he draws a crimson line between the worm scars.       *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*身后的人突然把性器整根没入，没有经过任何开拓润滑的小穴传来了撕裂的疼痛。 疼。 那是自然的，只有先疼了，你才会觉得后面有多么爽。 李振洋的歪理，岳明辉闭着眼睛也可以背出来。 没有前戏，没有亲吻，只有纯粹的情欲，满的快要从每一次毫不留情的撞击中溢出来，伴随着鲜血和疼痛，这是最能让李振洋性奋起来的东西。 岳明辉自暴自弃的笑，像是为了惩罚自己的犯贱似的，把腿张的更开了，好方便李振洋更完全的进入他。 “对…腿张开…”身后的那个人像是很满意岳明辉的配合，动作稍微放轻了点，伸手揉了揉他的头发，“还是你最清楚。” 岳明辉当然清楚。 李振洋喜欢跳蛋胜于按摩棒，喜欢肛交胜于口交，极其讨厌润滑剂，但好于前戏。 他再清楚不过，因为每一样，都是他用自己的身体，经历了数不清次数的粗暴的性爱，总结出来的。 他爱李振洋，爱到可以为他抛弃尊严。 在外面，他们是好兄弟；在家里，他是他的奴。 他可以吞下李振洋射在他嘴里的精液，甚至讨好的舔去沾留在性器上剩余的白浊；他可以像条狗一样的趴在地上，用唇虔诚的去亲吻李振洋的脚背。 ——只是因为他爱他。 “宝贝儿，走神了。”李振洋的声音把岳明辉拉回现实，身后的动作已经停了，份量满满的性器依旧插在他的后穴中，穴口一阵火辣辣的疼。 “应该怎么样惩罚你呢…”李振洋修长的手指缓缓抚过岳明辉的下巴，“这样都能走神啊…显然是不够刺激啊…” 跳蛋？串珠？ 岳明辉无所谓的想，反正最后都是要塞进他身体里的东西，有什么区别。 他顺从的含住李振洋的手指，任凭李振洋狠狠的捏住他的乳头，用指甲掐过那敏感的神经末梢。 “啊…”他吃痛的下意识想咬住口中的东西，可潜意识告诉他不可以，最后只是张着嘴一动不动，发出的呻吟也成了含糊不清的呜咽——— 最要命的是，那一阵钻心的疼痛过去，他竟感受到一种被凌虐的快感，从乳尖传到四肢，叫他原本疲软的阴茎颤颤巍巍的站了起来。 “哟，硬啦？” ———李振洋的调笑，几乎可以想到下一句话是， “还真是贱。” 岳明辉闭了闭眼睛。 当然不是第一次被说贱了。在他自己都看不起自己的情况下，他觉得李振洋并没有说错。 他是贱，贱到骨子里，天生就是欠操的料。 一个冰冷的球形物体被塞进后穴。 岳明辉猜是跳蛋。 他配合的抬起手，方便李振洋把他的手绑在床头，把脚分开，摆成M型。 后穴的跳蛋开始震动了，快感混合着些许的疼痛让他下意识的蜷起了身子。敏感点被死死的抵住，从不同角度相同力道的撞击，让他几乎是一下子就弃兵曳甲，臣服于快感的潮涌中。 可李振洋当然不会让他爽到—— 这是一场sm，主题是疼痛。 嘴唇被凶狠的啃咬，甜腥的味道在岳明辉舌尖绽开，却激起了李振洋的凌虐欲。 后穴被手指毫不留情的撑开，可以清晰的看到粉色的肠肉咬着那一枚小小的跳蛋，蠕动着，分泌出透明的肠液—— 那是太过色情的场面，李振洋只想把自己的性器塞进去，好好操弄岳明辉一番。 但还不是时候。 他咽了口口水，把跳蛋又往里推了推，换来了岳明辉的一声闷哼之后在床头柜里找到了一枚乳夹，也不知道什么时候买的，应该是一对，另一只却怎么也找不到。 一只也别有风味。 红肿的乳头被金属质地的夹子夹住，夹子上镶嵌的水钻在灯光下熠熠闪烁，连光芒都染上了色情的意味。另一个被冷落的也不堪示弱，在空气中硬了起来。 真是具淫荡的身体。 李振洋把跳蛋的开关调到了最大档，岳明辉身体颤抖的更加厉害了，嘴里抑制不住的吐出破碎的呻吟：“啊…不要…嗯…” 快感一层一层的累积，血液循环集中到下体，岳明辉的性器不禁吐出了透明的前列腺液，那是要攀上高潮的前兆，却被李振洋硬生生在半途中截断—— 勃起的茎身被布条裹牢，马眼被堵住，想要发泄却无处释放的快感累积起来，禁锢在难以纾解的灵魂里。 痛苦却爽快。 岳明辉眼角泛出泪来，这是李振洋最喜欢看到的，低下头吻去他眼角的晶莹，下一秒，性器便狠狠的撞进小穴。 性器和跳蛋的双重撞击实在是太过刺激，敏感点被重重的碾压，让岳明辉有了一种要被顶到内脏的错觉，喘息着想开口求饶，一张嘴却只剩下了委屈的呜咽。 好想射。 岳明辉的手腕因为长时间与布条的摩擦而泛了红，隐隐作痛，身后人抽插幅度的却不顾的一次次加大，脸上湿漉漉的，不知道是因为难受还是心痛。 真的很疼，李振洋，我真的很疼。 他开不了口，就算说了又怎么样呢，李振洋从不会顾及他的感受。 意识几近模糊的。 也许他是真的撑不下去了。 直到一股热流打在了肠壁上，他才感受到前端被释放。 射出来的那一刻，他眼前一黑，便什么都不知道了。 *~*TEXT*~*

He smelled of the wet earth and the crushed pine below, and when she looked at him the radiance of his spirit blinded, as the lightning blinded. First Ensi wondered, and then she knew; and never once did she close her eyes. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*    039. Burned * He remembered sundown in Almaty, back home — Yuri would visit during the off-season, jumping across walkway ledges and straining through the broken wire fences. It felt like they were more alive than ever. Yuri flicked Otabek's cheap, unfiltered cigarette butts onto the blacktop while they were alone in the basketball court outside a row of unlit, rundown apartments. He would lie back in the scratchy, overly dried grass, coughing on the  nastiness  of the beer bottle, his pouty, thin mouth scrunching up. His hand groped himself over his jeans, as soon as Otabek is looking, one of his knees bending up. Yuri licked his bottom, silvery-hoop pierced lip in a sensual and obvious and greedy  slowness , rucking up the fabric of his dark, ripped t-shirt to his pale and nearly skeletal chest. It's a  vision . His pink, untouched nipples bud underneath Otabek's lips, his tongue sweeping over Yuuri's warm, perspiring skin, coaxing him to moan underneath Otabek, swearing and roughly breathing as the other boy snatched onto Yuri's hips, dragging them upwards and grinding their erections harshly. Being young  faded  like the sun, immersed by a howling chasm of shadowy, cold obscurity. *   *~*TEXT*~*

He is used to having Lew caring for them, but Dick isn’t used to having the time to enjoy it.  “Do you like it?” Nix asks, blank but soft faced, watching Dick this time.  The Major looks up at his friend and smiles faintly, for just a moment.  “Yeah,” he sighs, watching as Lew throws the damp cloth aside to take a dry one to dry Dick’s wet thighs.  “I wish it could’ve been like this…”  “Yeah,” Dick agrees, shortly, knowing exactly what Lew meant and not really wanting to wonder about the wantings he-they couldn’t have had and probably wouldn’t in the future.  Lew seems to notice that and pulls Dick’s shorts up and leans over his lover.  “Good night, Dick,” he whispers, kissing Dick.  Dick smiles, trying to be hopeful for them, just a little bit at least.  “Good night, Lew.”  For a moment he stops though, he can just feel the end of the war in his toes and although he knows he should feel relieved, he is scared as a cold shiver runs up his body.  Noticing, Lew admonishes:  “Sleep.”  He will. Eventually. *~*TEXT*~*

But why do you have it?”  “To make curious green guys ask questions.”  “Leonard, do not tease.”  “Okay.  See?  It’s a small rubber ball.”  “Yes.”  “Now, I will pop it up inside me--”   Spock gasped.  “But how can you get it out?  There is no string on it.”  “Not my problem anymore.  It’s yours.  Can you figure out how to retrieve that ball without messing with me very much?"  A slow grin spread on Spock’s face.  “Oh, you are so good to me, Leonard." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*这是他漫长的魔生中罕见的狼狈时刻。 准确的说，这种命悬一线危在旦夕的感觉，只有在和南宫恨搏斗的时候才有。 现在他丢了一条左腿，半个左手手掌，右腿膝盖以下空荡荡，缓慢的冒出乌黑的还冒着热气的血液。他默默数着，破损的身体靠着岩石，网中人疼到视线都有些模糊，甚至不能给自己结个治疗的魔茧，右臂被炸的粉碎，止血也无能为力，这种失控的局面让他恼火，随之糟糕的预感从背后电流一样爬过，网中人猛地抬头，天上密密麻麻的妖魔无意义的呼嚎，宛如死亡的号角声。  还有比这个更糟糕的吗？ 妖魔海浪潮一样拍上他的身体，每一波浪潮都会给他留下漫长的痛苦，这些妖魔张开长着密密麻麻利齿的嘴，从他身上撕走一块块的肉，中毒而死的妖魔像是浪花拍碎在岸边的泡沫，飞回天空抽搐几下便丧失生机掉落下来，被一小群妖魔蜂拥而上吃掉，又是一簇碎掉的泡沫。 很快网中人身边便聚集起了一大片尸山血海。 他的身上遍布伤口，唯一完整的部位反而是小腹。衣服随着碎肉被撕扯殆尽，他几乎全裸着靠在岩石上。 网中人清楚，尸山血海会吸引更多的妖魔过来，毒素用完之后他就是一块任人宰割的肉。 现在他的毒素已经不多了，网中人咬牙思索脱身之法，受伤太重恢复能力只够他保持呼吸，想杀出一条路是不可能的事，堂堂妖神将居然沦落到如此境地，网中人看着蜂拥而上的妖魔感到穷途末路。  其实还有一条路，网中人动了动，血流的更快了。 并不算吃亏，他这样想着，身体无力的倒进尘土中，露出后背。一种难以言喻的气息混杂着血腥味，带着暗示刺激了整片妖魔海，被血腥味吸引的妖魔被另一种味道派遣了更加重要的任务。 超过食欲，这个味道提示他们——繁衍。  妖魔海再次拍上他的身体，浪潮席卷而来，这次网中人没有再释出毒素，他不想被压死。 这群没有意识的东西非常凶猛，他感觉自己瞬间被撑开了，粗糙的舌头和糙硬的毛发刮过他的身体，妖魔躁动不已。 他自己也分辨不出来这些妖魔都什么品种，不过不重要，网中人并不想记住这些信息。他弓起身体，小腹上的肌肉被血和汗水打湿，趴在他身上的巨兽利爪扣进他的肩膀，在他的后穴冲撞，猩红艳丽的血花一闪而逝，有压抑不住本性的妖魔在舔弄他身体的时候撕下伤口处的碎肉，网中人疼的皱眉。 他尽量集中意识在后穴，感觉那粗糙巨大的阳具愈来愈硬，被液体填充进身体的一瞬，网中人掐断了巨兽的脖子，虽然他只剩了半个手掌，也不是能小瞧的武力。 网中人掐着他的脖子，半硬的阳具从他后穴滑出，血的味道混杂着精液的腥气，下一只妖魔放开了舔舐网中人的侧腰，转而挺身进入。 为了难得的交配机会，被网中人释放的发情信息所惑，其余妖魔甚至有为了争夺交配权而争斗，这处荒地血腥味越来越浓烈。  网中人忙着进食，他急需恢复体力，这些妖魔的血肉能为他补充营养。趴在他身上舔舐的妖魔会无意识啃咬他的伤口，好不容易长出来的新肉又被撕扯掉，网中人并不气馁，他找到了方法。 这些妖魔的肉口感非常差劲，干硬还有股诡异的腥气，网中人目前没有挑食的选择，他也并不是个挑食的蜘蛛，不管什么猎物撞到了他的网上，他都会认真的照单全收，现在这些伤口已经不会再流出血。 后穴的精液塞的很满，网中人小腹微微有一点隆起，被灌得难受的时候网中人也会试着把精液挤出来，可是跪趴着的姿势很难抗拒让精液从肚子里倒流出去，他被顶弄得有些恶心。  画面诡艳中有一些神圣，妖魔为了繁衍排队送死，往往有些还没有射出来就被恢复部分体力的网中人扭断了脖子或者被插进胸膛的手捏爆了心脏，网中人把妖魔的血肉骨头拆出来，一开始他还吃的干净，后面越杀越多就把多余的肉块丢出去喂了。 长时间的性事费了他很多体力，若不然他还可以恢复的更迅速一点，他啃着手中的心脏，身后妖魔已经将精液注入抽出性器跑掉了，下一个抬高了网中人的屁股，还没插进去就被抓爆了头，网中人单手将这块肉拖到眼前，剥开胸膛。而身后的性事并没有停止，漫长的像一场拉锯战，网中人的胳膊比腿长得快些，一天的时间他吃出了一个尸堆，皮毛和骨头在他身下，他在尸堆的顶端继续进食，妖魔在上空盘旋还没有散去。 这时网中人的肚子已经鼓得很明显了，稍微一动大量的精液就会从后穴喷出，汩汩淌下，沿着新长出来的大腿内侧滑落进尸堆里。  感到自己魔力差不多恢复了部分，网中人使力震开周围的妖魔，撑出了网将自己保护起来。 本能指引他该如何面对。危险的魔气四散，没了交配的信息吸引，急速缩水的妖魔海终于退潮了，即便还有一些在不远处盘旋，对着尸堆垂涎三尺。也没有妖魔再聚集过来，网中人稍微松了一口气，旋即冷脸，对自己居然会对妖魔海这种低贱魔物而感到棘手而愤怒。  更让他愤怒的是身下的异样感，短短半天，精液排出了大半，他跪坐着沉下腰发力，纤长的手指探入体内摸索，最后不得不承认那些卡在穴内柔软有弹性的东西是他的孩子们。 网中人的肚子高高的鼓起来，肚子两侧甚至有撑起来太快而撕开的血痕。 他弯下腰弓起脊背，抱着肚子用力按下去，后穴尽力放松，几粒比拳头大的卵和血液一起流出他的身体，网中人一时有些脱力。 这些卵是由一层厚厚的透明膜包裹起来，膜本身很有弹性。网中人摸过一个卵用指甲撕开，这些东西没有资格做他的孩子。 没有什么可以带走了他好不容易吸收的营养，他冷漠的撕开卵壳将一个个卵凑到嘴边，像吸果冻一般吃了个精光。 要生完他们必死无疑，网中人每按着肚子产下几枚就撕开几个吃掉，被撕开的卵膜变硬脆化以后顺着尸堆咕噜噜滚下去。 余晖逆着光打在网中人身上，为他赤裸的身体镀一圈金边，他跪坐在尸堆之上，仰着头饮下最后一个卵，蛛丝从小腹喷出包裹住了他的身体。 太阳落下，魔茧竖在骨堆之上。 掩住月光的云层被吹向东南的风推开，阴恻恻照亮这片荒地，这里只剩狂风和黄土，那块沾着网中人血迹的岩石，也化作了尘土，在狂风的凄厉哀嚎下与云层无声无息的被吹走。 end *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~**内含自x道具play  脏 慎入     "你有多久没做过爱了。"  半年。  看到那封邮件，岳明辉几乎是下意识的在心里回答道，反应过来又暗骂自己脑子有病，竟然会去回答一个变态的问题。  他并不是个禁欲主义者，也不是未经人事的小处男，只是他实在羞于对他人言说他的性向——  他是弯的，还是喜欢在下面的那个。  李振洋温柔触碰的质感仿佛还留在皮肤上，触碰过的地方比其他都要炽热而滚烫，岳明辉呆呆的站在水槽前，回味着刚才和李振洋交流的一点一滴——  他安抚自己时温柔而让人安心的语气，给自己夹菜时的体贴细心，临走时那个略显亲昵的动作……  他在脑海里回放了一遍又一遍，直到手中的碗因无意识的松开而与槽底发出清脆的碰撞声时，才把他从沉醉中清醒过来——手指因为长时间浸泡在水中而有了苍白的褶皱，他慌忙的把剩下的碗胡乱的洗好归位，心却乱的不成样子。  他为什么会对李振洋有感觉？  明明只是雇主和雇员的关系。  难道只是因为他给了自己那种久违的安全感?  岳明辉摇头，眼前却兀然浮现白天在邮箱中看到的淫乱不堪的照片——  长相清秀的男孩被男人摁在身下以羞耻的方式毫不留情的狠狠贯穿，青筋毕露的性器在股间若隐若现。  岳明辉的呼吸一下子急促了好几分，他能清晰的感受到自己浑身的血液违反了原本流动的方向，拼了命的往下身那个部位送。  他大概明白是为什么了。  在他的幻想中，狠狠贯穿他的那个人，是李振洋。  裆部的隆起已经难以忽视，他难以理解为什么性欲来得如此迅速而猛烈，身体却诚实的跌跌撞撞的来到了卧室。  情欲如潮水般铺天盖地的涌来，近日因高度紧张而忽略了的所有微妙的情绪全部变成了对性的兴奋难耐，通过电流传递到每一个敏感的神经末梢。  最后的理智用来提醒自己拉上窗帘，岳明辉胡乱的扯下自己的裤子，毫无章法的抚慰着自己的性器，渴望通过这种最原始的方式来度过这场情潮。  可他实在是太小瞧了自己的身体。  后穴隐约传来的空虚感像是蚂蚁的啃咬，并不致命，却让人难受的无法忽视。  色情图片中男人粗壮的性器又浮现在他眼前，岳明辉闭了闭眼睛，单纯的撸管所能带来的快感实在是捉襟见肘，反而对他更像是火上浇油，欲望不但没有被纾解，而是变本加厉的往上涨。  他颤抖着摸向自己的后穴，那里早就湿了，肠液把在穴口按揉试探的手指指尖打湿了一大片，穴口微微张开，像是在欢迎异物的进入。  "嗯……"  他闷哼了一声，缓缓送进了第一根手指。  许久未使用的甬道骤然迎来了新的客人，像是濒临倒闭的店铺起死回生，在最初的不适之后便是难以满足的贪婪，第二根第三根接连插入，也只是觉得稍稍缓解了一下急躁的欲火，并不是长远之计。  但总好过什么都没有。  胸前的红缨痒的出奇，岳明辉的另一只手自觉的抚慰着受到冷落的乳珠，因为工作原因手指上磨出的老茧蹭过凸起，竟丝毫不比后穴的刺激所带来的快感少。  指尖摩擦的触感带了几分熟悉，岳明辉被情欲搅成一团浆糊的脑子闪过几丝清明，又很快重新沉溺。  那是李振洋带给自己的触感。  "李振洋……李振洋……"  两种相似的触感在记忆和现实中模糊了界限，在快感的恍惚中，岳明辉甚至觉得是李振洋的手在自己的后穴中抽插，是他的手蹂躏着自己胸前的敏感。  他喃喃的喊他名字，眼神是近乎痴迷的空白。  "我想射……嗯……让我射……"  他想要攀上愉悦的巅峰，可手指能带来的快感也只是隔靴搔痒，怎么能比得上男人的那个玩意儿。  求而不得的高潮让岳明辉完完全全成为了欲望的奴隶，他拉开底层抽屉，拿出压在最底下藏的严严实实的东西。  是一个黑色的按摩棒。  许久不曾使用，陌生的尺寸对于自己用手指扩张过的岳明辉来说还是够呛，对冰凉的润滑剂实在没有好感的岳明辉盯着它犹豫了没有半秒钟，就张嘴含住了顶端。  粉色的舌尖与黑色的塑胶成了鲜明的对比，让人血脉贲张的画面如今只有唯一的观众，岳明辉把按摩棒舔湿了，吃力的支撑起自己因为情欲而浑身瘫软的身子，以一种无比羞耻的姿势，用后面的小穴一点一点的吞了下去——  大腿淫荡的摆成了M型，白皙而柔软的臀瓣向后高高翘起，像是等待着什么人狠狠揉捏，粉色的穴口含着因为过长而无法整根吞入的黑色性爱玩具，色情的像是某个钙片的拍摄现场。  岳明辉迫不及待的伸手打开了开关，却用力过度的摁到了最大档，敏感点毫无防备的被攻击，一瞬间过多的快感顿时烧掉了他所有的神经——  他尖叫着射了出来，然后在高潮的余韵中久久不能自拔。  他自然不会注意到电视机后闪烁着的红光。        第二天起床时，岳明辉收到了一条匿名彩信。  图片是视频的截图，内容是昨天晚上他喊着李振洋名字自慰时脸上痴迷的近乎淫荡的表情，连带着配字把岳明辉打入黑暗而绝望的深渊——  "如果我把这个寄给李振洋呢。" *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*very short one shot, something bad happens at the cop con *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The cop-con was usually a highlight for Amy. It was one of her favorite times of the year. She got to party and just let loose with the people she loved. This year was different. It was just  after three am and Amy was in her hotel room tears in her eyes. As soon as she had closed the door behind her, she broke down.   She tried to tell herself that it wasn't a big of a deal. It was a party. Everyone was dancing provocatively. She did dress like a slut. In any other situation she would feel differently, she told herself. Amy could feel foreign hands crawl down her sides. They grabbed her ass and when she tried to move away the they twisted forward grabbing at her crotch. She pushed him off moving away. Amy didn't even know who the hands belonged too, just that they were unwelcome.   Amy whipped her tears away and stood up. "I am stronger than this," she whispered to herself. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Inko’s body is made up of stretch marks that span the roadmap of her soft skin; across her stomach, her hips, her thighs, the backs of her knees, her breasts. Of curves and rolls and folds he wants to lose himself in, little scars from mundane things, unlike his.  Toshinori is made up of a scars that tell of a bloody history—of staples and surgeries, of missing organs, of regret, of loss, the wear and tear of his quirk. Of sharp angles and deep shadows, of heart and courage, Of strength; unlike hers.  And yet, as they lay together, touching each other like the first time they’d ever touched someone, to explore, to adore, to know each other. With soft hands and fluttering hearts, with pleasured gasps and sweat dripping between them, they learn what makes the other tick. With soft eyes, they find love in each other.  They find their homes. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*告知目的地的休假就不再是休假。 Ethan曾经这样告诉Sean，并且毫不犹豫地贯彻执行。 这就是为什么Sean有机会获得假扮Ethan的机会；获得Nekhorvich博士的信任；获得自己另一种人生的选择权。事实上，Sean叛逃这一天的到来，Ethan心里早有预感——毕竟Sean在种种任务中所表现出的弑杀是无法也从未想过隐藏的。只是如同是Ethan的天性，他总会对身边的人抱有某种期待，希冀他们能够战胜自我。 人怎么能够因为尚未发生的事情，而对他人预判有罪？ 或许是因为他做了太多次两难的选择，所以他拥有了一种殉道者般的精神，能够一次次重建自身的精神世界，然而并非人人都是Ethan Hunt。 Sean对Ethan的想法嗤之以鼻，但这并不妨碍他喜欢和Ethan在一起。他们拥有同样出色的头脑，同样利落矫健的身手，而更妙的是，Ethan Hunt有一张漂亮的脸，并且不介意在某些特定的时候，为他臣服。 虽然Ethan是一个普通的Beta，但是他的身体却可以比Omega更柔软诱人——或许这就后天课程的重要性。一个不容易被情欲控制的Beta总比Alpha和Omega更容易完成任务，而他和Ethan的差别，仅仅局限于此，只要抑制剂足够，他完全和Ethan并驾齐驱。 Ethan的这种容忍度极大地取悦了Sean，但同样也导致了当Ethan和他提出分手时，他的暴怒呈几何增长。而现在，解毒剂Bellerophon在Sean的手上，只要再获得Chimaera病毒，从此之后，金钱、财富、地位和美人都会滚滚而来，他又何须在意一个Ethan？ 然而，他总会忍不住想Ethan下一个新男朋友或者女朋友究竟是谁？是那个总处处护着他的顶头上司John Musgrave，还是那个处处给予他电脑协作的Luther Stickell？是未来某个任务中发现的相关人物，还是某个与他并肩作战的队友——这两者结合起来，听着就像是Sean本人，尤其是目前的Sean本人。  Ethan Hunt进了监狱，他作为一个叛逃者，一个恐怖分子被投入监狱。 看看，这就是作为一个IMF特工最后的下场，被他所忠诚的国家所背叛抛弃，被他的上司和同僚们怀疑。Sean曾经无数次地提醒他，而他却好像总是学不会似的。 他该明白了，也该学会了。 究竟谁才是能够给予他依赖和保护的人，究竟谁才是他所信任和可靠的人。 Sean偏执地想证明这点，所以他几乎动用了所有不可言说的关系将Ethan从层层关卡中救出，同时他的心中也在庆幸：若非Ethan的母亲已经病故，Ethan绝不可能如此顺从地离开。 Sean没想到的是，这一次的偏执，竟然让他得到了一个秘密——Ethan Hunt是一个Omega。Ethan隐藏得如此之好，以至于他们曾经朝夕相处的过程中，他也从未发现任何不对劲，只以为对方是一个对信息素不够敏感的Beta。而事实上，他却是一个不可想象的Omega。 还有比这更好的事吗，还有比这更妙的事吗？ 只要他标记了Ethan，从此以后，这个活在无数传奇中最优秀的特工就仅仅属于他，服从于他，不能抵抗……他们的基因甚至可以创造一个最优秀的后代，属于Ethan的面容和他们的智慧，属于他的冷酷果决和他们的身手。这种狂喜冲昏了他的头脑，也让他立即就做了决定。 Sean在和Ethan再度会面的当天晚上就彻彻底底地标记了他。 一碰到Ethan的事，Sean就像昏了头。作为最得力的手下，Hugh警告Sean，Ethan Hunt出现的时间实在太过巧合，换来的却是Sean用雪茄剪弄伤了他的手指。Hugh知道Sean的残酷和暴虐——这也是他愿意跟随Sean的原因，果决和狠厉。但这也不是全部的原因，对待自己人，Sean足够大方和维护才是重点。 “你在担心什么？”Sean的脸上满是不悦，“你是觉得我不能控制一个已经被我标记的Omega吗？”他蹲下身，与Hugh平视：“即使他别有目的又怎么样？他愿意送上门，我就一定能够玩够他。” 他还记得Ethan为他彻底敞开的身体，因为发情而引起的高热体温，以及不断渴求的收缩和攀附于他身上的肢体……沉而甜的巧克力味萦绕在Sean的鼻尖，Ethan这方面的功课着实拿得是高分。 “你的味道……好像和之前不一样？”他心里隐隐有了猜测，IMF里层出不穷的发明和药品中，有那么一两种短暂掩盖的也并不奇怪。 “这是……真正的我。”Ethan断断续续的话佐证了Sean的猜测，送到嘴边的吻比每一次都热烈和期待，柔软的舌头探入他的唇齿，身后湿漉漉的液体不断流出，浑身上下都留恋着Sean的一切。 Sean感觉身上信息素也被这浓郁的巧克力味引诱出来，铺天盖地的架势让他确定了眼前的Ethan究竟是什么性别。暴怒和狂喜同时涌上他的心头：这样一个人竟然是可以被他轻易征服的，这样一个Omega竟然敢进入监狱！ IMF拥有Omega类型的特工，他们通常被训练自身的天赋项目，成为色诱勾引活动中的重要一环。而Ethan从没有表现过在这方面的突出天分——更确切地说，正是因为他在每一项科目中，都表现出优异的天分和成绩，因此反而从没让人想过他会是一个靠着张开腿完成任务的Omega。 没错，在他眼里，Omega就是如此，运用自己与生俱来的天赋，张张腿完事的婊子们。Ethan Hunt或许不一样，或许也是一路货色。  那个时候，他哪里想得到Ethan Hunt远远比他想的对自己更狠。他以为标记Ethan便可以控制他，便会让他有所顾忌。然而事实证明，能让Ethan Hunt低头的永远只有更多无辜者的生命。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*蓝白格手帕上是好闻的男士香水，Hermes大地，经过一天的时间香味已并不浓烈，只剩下尾调西洋杉若有若无的清香，夹杂着微不可闻的柑橘的香甜，勾得人心不由自主的悸动———— 就像手帕的主人。 李振洋轻笑，不禁伸出舌尖舔了舔柔软的手帕——仿佛自己在舔岳明辉为了掩饰紧张而尴尬的笑时嘴角不经意露出的小虎牙。 岳明辉大概没意识到自己有多诱人——可爱而俏皮的虎牙和身上成熟男人的气息完美混合，矛盾而叫人欲罢不能，而眼中掩饰不住的惧怕则成了李振洋欲望的最好的催情剂。 他硬了，对着一块岳明辉的手帕。 下体涨的发疼，李振洋拿起手机看了一下放在岳明辉家楼下对着岳明辉家拍的针孔摄像机的画面，一片漆黑，想必是睡觉了。 他摇下车窗，晚风拂过脸上带了点丝丝凉意，可情欲却像是一团火在小腹熊熊燃烧着，炙热而滚烫。 "岳明辉……" 他低声喊着他的名字，像是在念捕猎名单上的猎物，嘴角勾起的笑意变态而残忍，带着一抹扭曲的快意。 他的手熟练的抚上性器，粗糙的指腹在敏感的龟头摩擦，掌心包裹住柱身上下套弄，另一只手则照顾后面的囊袋——快感立竿见影，可对于纾解欲望却只是杯水车薪，毕竟自己能给自己的快感就这么点，远远比不上真枪实弹的本垒打。 不够。 李振洋难耐的扬起了脑袋，金丝眼镜的镜片折射出星火燎原般欲望。 他需要更多的刺激。 一旁的手帕映入眼帘。 他一把抓过手帕，着急的把它覆在了性器之上来回套弄——沾染了岳明辉气息的手帕成了岳明辉的替身，李振洋闭上眼睛，想象着岳明辉跪在自己身前吞吐着自己的性器—— 尽管柔软可对于器官来说仍旧粗糙的布料照顾着每一处的神经末梢，快感像电流般在瞬间传遍了四肢。 ——他会因为含着过大的性器无法换气而憋的眼角通红满是生理性的泪水，他会在他语言的教导下生涩的用舌头舔舐吮吸着性器的每一处，他会尝试着做人生的第一次深喉。 一阵凉风吹过，把他从欲望中惊醒，本能的打了个激灵，意识到自己现在的处境———— 他在车里，车停在路边，只要有人走过随时都可以通过大开的车窗看到他，拿着雇主的一块手帕，自慰。 随时可能被人发现的刺激感转变成了精神上的变态快感，李振洋的性器又变硬了几分。 不够，还不够。 他伸手打开随身携带着的录音笔，岳明辉带了点惊惧的声音回荡在车中。 "我乘地铁的时候总觉得有人在蹭我的皮肤……" ———他会在自己身下张开双腿，努力用贪吃的后穴吞下性器，他会用绞紧后穴，用紧致的甬道来迎接那被填满的快感，他的臀瓣上满是拍打出来的红印，色情而诱惑。 "早上晨跑也是……" ———他会哭着求自己慢一点，往敏感点猛烈的撞击让他软成了一滩水，瘫在床上只有哭着求饶的份；他会胡乱的喊自己老公，声音里带着迷离的哭腔，高潮的时候虎牙在自己肩膀上留下染着血丝的印记。 "您一定会帮我解决的吧……我有些怕……" ———他的后穴会被高频率的抽插而操的泛红，白色的液体会顺着红肿的穴口缓缓淌下，再也无法正常合拢，他会因为高潮而爽到双眸失神，没了灵魂的瞳孔里只能装下自己一人。 我会帮你解决的。 李振洋摊开手帕，蓝白的格子被乱七八糟的液体弄得一塌糊涂。他胡乱的擦了擦自己的下身，然后把手帕对折，郑重的塞进了西装内衬的口袋里。 手指上沾上了零星的白浊，他勾了勾嘴角，舌尖在指腹轻轻舔过，像只在暗处捕食猎物的毒蛇。 只不过要看你的表现了。 *~*TEXT*~*

"I can't be around here, I can't take every single time they think you and Reed are a couple again!!!"  Sue sighed.  That was true. She and Reed had once been a couple when she had been trying to fight her feelings for her younger brother but now they were together instead. In secret.  Sure she and Reed had been working together on getting their powers sorted out.  There was nothing between them. Nothing. Why couldn't he understand that?  "You know what? You're a pain in the ass!"  "You still like him!"  "How can I when I'm completely in love with my pain in the ass little brother?!" She snapped, scowling and walking past him, only to find herself pinned against the wall.  "Did you mean that?"  "That you're a pain in the ass? Yes.''  "Cute." He chuckled slightly, pressing her lips against hers.  Sue inwardly rolled her eyes.

*~*TEXT*~*Every night, you devour her again. Seres is your sister, but at the same time, she isn't. She might have Celica's face but your sister's emotions had never run so hot: never such deep burning anger, never such scorching passion. Celica never left you feeling the way you do: blood burning in your veins, feeling like you might boil dry and turn to dust. Lips at her neck as your fangs closed around flesh, licking the very salt from her skin. Your bodies press together, but you want to get closer, closer even than your own cursed flesh. “Velvet, I wanted you to do it,” Seres had said, once upon a nightmare. “Even had I survived, I would have given myself to you before long.” You devour it all: her hatred, her grief, her anger. In return, she offers up the only intimacy she can offer; that of blood and flesh and bone.   *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Shiro turns into a dragon via his cybernetic arm. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The sound of his heart beating fast and hard, when Shiro gazed upwards at the ring of Galra about him.  His eyes blinking out the bright light they struck him with.  Amounts of pure quintessential power surge through him, and it was too much. The Cybernetic arm inching over the muscle of his arm and over his chest in his horror.  He screamed, it was like liquid hot metal rippling over the scarred flesh.  Any moment he wake up surely.  But it kept enveloping him.   Those frightened eyes frantically running back and forth as it even covered his face. A loud rumbling sound came from his chest, when he felt the restraints and table give away.  His neck seem to stretch, with majestic crown of horn atop his head and he grew a tail that thrashed at the druids trying to flee from the spell gone wrong. The silver dragon awoke and spread outwards his giant wing span and he was breathing dark flames of quintessence fire.  Wrecking the ritual room, and breaking the rune looking him in place, when his claws raked at the seal. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Shiro is working out, and his body changes.  Keith is supposed to spot him. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Shiro aware there felt like his skin was on fire.  In the gym right then, trying to concentrate upon his daily routine.  At first he figured he pushed himself too far, until he saw a slight skin rip upon his forearm.  That didn’t look good, and what was sharp enough to had open his flesh.  Looking everywhere for the sharpness.  Failing to locate it, he taped it up, not thinking of it anymore and went into the next reps.  His eyes staring ahead, until he heard that pop again, and a sharp pain this time.  He beetled his eyebrows, until he saw Keith walk in. What Shiro hadn’t know, the last fight with one of the druids had placed a cogitation within his blood stream.  It had replicated out of control and was taking over his human cellular structure.  At this very moment, the catalyst for turning into some sort of were form of Galra had started it’s cycle.  The trigger for this, the increase serotonin within his body when he worked out.   “Hey, you… you were supposed to spot me…." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*• 少量脐橙/咬 • 少年冰哥对自己师尊的一点妄想 胸口闷闷的，不寻常的热意涌遍全身，洛冰河迷迷糊糊地睁开眼，却在看清当下状况时愣住了。 有人跨坐在他双腿之间，起起伏伏，下面还吞吐着……吞吐着他的性器。少年一下便慌了起来，月明似水，将这间窄小柴房映得分明，却因那人背对木窗，叫他看不清脸。洛冰河几乎手忙脚乱，他第一次遇到这种事，不知该怎么处理才好。虽然羞耻，但最私密最敏感的部位被湿湿热热地包裹起来，少年同样从中觉察到一丝丝快意，性器更硬了。 此种想法一出，洛冰河更为激烈地挣扎起来，他一时间几欲羞愧而死：自己是来拜师修行，以慰母亲在天之灵，却沉迷……沉迷于肉欲！ 然而，对方仅仅轻巧地做了几个手势，便桎住了他的反抗。洛冰河仿佛突然被人点醒，他愣愣地喊：“师尊？” 这次换成上方的人不动了。 良久，他缓缓俯下身，贴近了。被这人是师尊的事实所震惊，洛冰河顿时呆住了，任凭对方靠近，还傻乎乎闭上了眼。 等了许久，一枚冰凉的吻落在了他的眉间。 再次睁开眼，眉心濡湿的触感已经消散在了空气中。 是个梦。洛冰河不无遗憾地想。 此时此刻，他才明白自己对师尊抱着怎样大不敬的念头。他揣着满裤裆精水、满腹千回百转、满腔少年心思，惶惶然了。 正当他胡思乱想之际，下身突然被什么柔软的东西触碰了一下。这与梦境相似的遭遇让他猛地跳起来，发现榻边跪坐着一个人。 和梦里一样，这晚同样是明月夜。 和梦里不一样，月亮更大、更亮，他看得清清楚楚，榻边之人便是梦中人！ 沈清秋似乎被他突然坐起的动作吓了一跳，皱着眉低下头，在刚才的部位继续舔舐，熟练得仿佛做过千百次。鲜红的舌尖伸出一点，又快速缩回去，却让梦遗之后凉飕飕的胯间重新热了起来。 洛冰河万万没想到，自己一朝竟有梦想成真的好运气。清静峰峰主，神仙般的人物，从来连一个眼神都吝于施舍，此刻却跪在弟子面前，隔着亵裤为他舔弄性器。 就好比可望不可及的一捧白月光，突然化作了绕指柔。 洛冰河在渎神。 少年对师尊的妄想照进现实，他动也不敢动，生怕轻轻一碰，这一响贪欢便变为水中月、镜中花。 沈清秋咬着亵裤下拉，勃勃性器立刻跳了出来，在他脸上打出轻微的“啪”的一声响。少年人身体青涩，性器却怒张，青筋虬结之上，还挂着水淋淋的精水。他先是伸舌一点一点、从根至顶地舔净了，接着整根含入，一直抵到喉头。清浅的鼻息若有似无地打在耻毛之上，马眼被喉头软肉圈住吸吮，惹得洛冰河性器一阵胀大，沈清秋再含不住，嘴角不受控制地流出几道晶亮涎液，噎得很了，连眼角眉梢都飞上几抹绯红。 洛冰河无法忍受，妥协一般合眼，把自己交代在了沈清秋嘴里。 第三次睁开眼，洛冰河发现自己出现在魔宫的宴会之上。 玉杯象箸，酒池肉林。 众魔欢呼，庆祝圣君一统三界，万岁万岁万万岁。 他笑了。 推开扒在身上的不知哪儿来的女人，洛冰河举起酒杯振臂高呼：“喝酒！” 洛冰河想，我本一心向明月，奈何此人不是明月，是明月底下的沟渠，混着腥臭的烂泥、腐烂的鸟雀尸体，好食腐肉的秃鹫扑棱着翅膀啄食。 他想起清静峰上的一个春日。 东风和煦，沈清秋领着弟子们在竹林荫凉处练剑。零星的细伶竹叶晃晃悠悠从枝头飘落，沈清秋素来重视自身体面，眼看着竹叶悄咪咪将要飘至他肩头，便有童稚弟子忍不住捂嘴偷笑。可惜那片绿意还未完全落下，便已被灵力粗暴地拂了开去，叶片碎裂，散在风里。 “金粉未消亡，闻得六朝香，满天涯烟草断人肠，怕催花信紧，风风雨雨，误了春光。 ” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*“Are you sure you want to do this?” Murray, Xalina’s assistant, asked. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“Are you sure you want to do this?” Murray, Xalina’s assistant, asked.  “I’m sure.” She asserted, allowing Murray to strap her onto a wooden table. After putting a leather strap in her mouth to bite down on, he picked up a sharp hacksaw and pressed it against one of her horns. He began to saw through it, causing Xalina to scream through the strap. Murray grimaced as he attempted to tune it out.  “We’re almost through the first horn.” He assured her. Xalina’s reply was lost in the strap, but Murray didn’t doubt that it involved an insult. Once he’d finished sawing off the first horn, he set it aside and quickly bandaged the wound before starting on the second. Xalina’s vision began to blur, but she refused to give in.   When the second horn had been removed and she’d been unstrapped from the table, Xalina pressed her hands to her bloodied scalp and healed the wounds.  “Are you okay?” Murray asked, wiping his hands down with a damp cloth.  “I’m fine.” Xalina grunted, handing him a heavy coin purse, “This should cover your fee.”  Before Murray could object, Xalina stood unsteadily, and left. Her new life could begin now. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*一旦进入深夏，夜晚就成了一天难得清凉的时候，也正因如此街心公园一到了晚上，散步的人就异常多。  今天街心公园里散步的人比往常还要多一些。比较令人惊奇的是散步团里大部分都是男性，从少年到中年甚至是老年，跨越了整整三个年龄层。这三个年龄层的人们聚集在一起居然没有丝毫代沟，兴致勃勃地交头接耳。  “哎，你听没听说，西南角的那个公厕……”  “知道知道，等前面这批过去了，就能轮到咱们了......”  ……  “不……要了……要被撑坏了，不行……呜啊——”瘦弱的少年被摁在公厕的隔间里，身后一个穿着背心的民工正架着他的双腿大力地操干着，紫红色的鸡巴在少年红肿的小穴里进进出出，带出了一股股粘液，全是少年肉穴里分泌的骚水。  “撑坏个屁！你下边这张骚嘴把我的鸡巴咬得这么紧，就没见过你这么饥渴的骚货。路边卖的鸡都没你水多。”男人一边骂骂咧咧，一边快速地挺动自己的腰，“骚货，你叫什么名字？在哪上学？我到你学校去把你干爆好不好？”  “嗯......唔啊......骚货......骚货叫lof，在app中学读高二......啊啊啊啊捅到了，捅到骚心了！”名叫lof的少年身下的小肉棒抖了抖直直地射了出来，稀薄的精液全射到了男人的胸膛上。  “干，你个婊子还敢射我身上？”男人的怒火一下子起来了，“今天不把你操烂你别想爬出这扇门。”  男人转过身打开了隔间的门，外面竟然排着一条长队，一眼扫过去少说也有十几个人。  “后面的兄弟再来一个呗，难得有个不要钱的妓女，咱们不玩个双龙多可惜啊。”男人往身后的队伍里吆喝。  一个清洁工放开了手里的扫帚，畏手畏脚地走了出来，看着隔间里瘫倒在坐便器上的lof有些担忧：“不会操坏了吧？”  男人嗤笑一声，把刚高潮完的lof拽起来脸朝下摔在了地上。  lof的大白屁股朝着排队的人群撅了起来，两股间的洞被操得早就合不上了，红肿的肠肉抽出时被带了出来，半天收不回去。敞开的肉洞正汩汩地往外吐着精液，哪怕是窑子里接客最多的妓女都没他这么淫贱。  男人踹了一脚lof的屁股，把鞋尖踢进了肉穴里不客气地来回搅拌，再收回来时鞋面上已经一片水色。男人把湿了的鞋尖伸给众人看：“瞧这骚洞，没鸡巴堵着，水都要流成太平洋了，还怕两根鸡巴一起上？”  清洁工咽了咽口水，觉得男人说得都是大实话，他活了五十多年还从来没见过这么浪的男娃。他不再犹豫，掏出自己的鸡巴迫不及待地走了过去。  lof惊恐地睁大了眼睛，慌乱着手脚想往后爬。可身边的男人一把扯住了他的胳膊，直接把lof像抱小孩撒尿一样抱了起来，鸡巴直挺挺地从下往上插进了那个肿得合不上的骚洞。  清洁工扶着鸡巴从前面逼近，在lof惊恐的眼神中，把龟头塞进了穴口边缘的缝隙，无视lof凄厉的尖叫，一鼓作气捅了进去。  两根狰狞的鸡巴现在都插进了lof的肉穴里，把lof的小腹都撑得凸出来了，屁眼上再没一丝褶皱，好似再用点力就会直接撕裂开来。  但是没有人会对路边捡来的骚货起同情心，只会想着怎么在他身上占更多的便宜。两个人根本不给lof缓冲的机会，跟比赛似得争先恐后地在lof的后穴里冲刺，那淌着水的肠道就是他们的赛场。  等到两人同时喘着粗气射进lof体内的时候，lof已经疼晕了过去，只有被撑开的后穴还在无意识地痉挛，两条腿大张着不停地抽搐。  男人不满地伸手抠了几下lof的穴肉，lof半天连眼睫都没颤一下，淫水倒是被挖出来了一大滩。  男人瞅着lof的紧闭的眼睛，心里突然一动，鸡巴隐隐作痒：“有哪个兄弟想尿尿的？让这个骚货被尿醒醒脑，总这样在地上躺着怎么行，后面还那么多兄弟呢。”  立刻有几个壮硕的男人应声而出，掏出鸡巴蠢蠢欲动。  男人和清洁工连手把lof平放在了满是污水的地上，围上来的几个人互相看了一眼，淫笑着把鸡巴对准了lof那张可爱的小脸，几股金黄的液体喷射而出，全浇在了lof的脸上。  一些尿水灌进了lof的口鼻里，lof茫然地睁开眼呛咳了起来，无意识地舔了一下嘴边的液体，入口全是刺鼻的腥臊。  “哈哈，这个骚货喜欢喝尿啊。”围着lof的几个人哄笑出声，他们的马眼还滴着金黄色的尿液，全都直愣愣地冲着lof的脸。  后面上来的一个索性用手强行打开了lof的嘴，把鸡巴塞了进去，舒爽地尿完了满肚子的水后，湿淋淋的鸡巴直接在lof的脸上蹭了蹭，俨然是把lof的脸当成厕纸来擦了。  后面的人看得一个二个尿意全上来了，排着队等着上厕所。  这可是人形肉便器啊，他们顶多在小毛片里看过，哪见到过真人版，还是比片里都骚的那种。不尿一发再走，回去得后悔一个月。  “唔......喝不下了，真的喝不下了。”lof捂着嘴推拒着下一个来他嘴里上厕所的男人，仿佛再下一秒就会全呕出来。  男人看了看他鼓起来的小腹，郁闷地踹了一脚：“倒霉。”  视线不经意瞥过lof泥泞不堪的下半身，男人突然脑子里灵光一现，把lof翻了个身，鸡巴戳进了闭不上的屁眼里，插到最深的地方后，射出了一大股滚烫的尿液。  “上面喝不下，下面不是还很能喝嘛？”男人笑着拍了拍lof的屁股，“大家别担心啊，这骚货屁股能吃着呢，都被双龙过了，还能怕咱们这点水？”  后面的人得到了启发，不管lof是怎样地哭叫，摁着腰就把lof的屁眼当成马桶去上，纷纷尿进了lof的屁眼里。  等到散步的大部队来到公厕时，只看见了一个肚子夸张隆起的少年，浑身一股腥臊味仰躺在地上。身上身下全是精液和尿液，双眼也没什么焦距，连舌头都吐了出来，一看就是被操坏了。  慕名而来的人们大失所望，摇着头叹着气走了：“什么嘛，不是说是白白嫩嫩的高中生吗？怎么就成了肉便器了。” *~*TEXT*~*

Looking over at my nightstand I see my phone as the last ring rung. With a sigh a reach over unplugging it as I use my thumb print to unlock it, the glass of the screen feeling cold to my still half asleep mind.  Looking down as notifications suddenly popped up causing a soft groan to leave from my mouth. I look over at the person in the bed next to me before turning back to my phone, just Taehyung being Taehyung I noted. I sent him a quick  ‘I’m alright I’ll txt u later’  as I turn my phone off shortly after. I really need to find a way to sneak out of this bunny faced strangers apartment...      Wait ..     Why the fuck am I in bed with a bunny faced stranger..  .  .  .  .  ...oh yeah....fuck that fucking tequila, assignment gone wrong, and this bunny faced alpha stranger..oh wait I already did that last one. *~*TEXT*~*

He almost let it out when Ignis traced a tongue up then down his cock, swirling at the tip then sucking long and hard, and  Oh gods , he was going to… Ignis let go with a lingering suck and Prompto almost groaned at the loss. But then Ignis worked his way up Prompto’s body, kissing, licking, caressing, following the contours with lips and tongue and teeth and fingers. Prompto shivered. "Iggy, gods,  please ..." "Guess I win, love." Deft fingers fell on his entrance in a wicked caress and Prompto screamed. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Rodney groaned, pushing back, trying to get John deeper. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Rodney groaned, pushing back, trying to get John deeper. He needed John inside him. He hadn't known it was possible to need this much, hadn't wanted to know.  But he had wanted to love. And John was easy to love.  He just hadn't realized that needing was part of loving.  John's hands tightened on his hips, guiding Rodney's movements, as John brought them together in perfect rhythm, again and again.  And again.  Rodney moved his knees a little farther apart and dropped from his hands to his elbows, pushing his ass farther into the air, changing the angle of John's penetration. John was hitting his prostate with every stroke and the pleasure was almost overwhelming.  Greedy for more, Rodney tried to move faster, but John leaned over his back, whispered in his ear. "Shh, let me do this, Rodney. Please. Please."  Rodney had no defenses when John said please. None. He groaned.  John's weight left his back, and the stroking resumed, steady and deep. John was caressing him with his cock, touching Rodney deep inside, sending pleasure shooting through him.  It wasn't enough.  But it would do. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*赵云澜下飞机的时候已经是凌晨三点了，还是深秋，龙城半夜就下起了小雨。上一趟还是恨不得打赤膊的G市，转眼就来了个寒风夹雨，犹是自诩是铁打的赵云澜，穿着那么一件薄薄的T恤，也忍不住搓了搓手。   真他娘的冷啊。   只他一人，赵云澜也不太在意，远远看到有出租车打着灯，正要招手叫停，一辆黑色的轿车远处驶过来，稳稳地停在他面前。   自看到那车起，刚才还心急火燎的赵处倒静下来了，还悠闲插着兜。   他吊儿郎当地叼着只没点着的烟，看着缓缓摇下的车窗，眯起眼，笑道：   “沈教授，真这么挂念着我啊？”    撞入车内男人漆黑的眼眸。       小别胜新婚这句话，当真一点没错。   车还没到家，赵云澜就忍不住倚过去对着一本正经开着车的沈教授往耳蜗里吹气，一副搔首弄姿的样子，特别是当他贱兮兮地笑着问没有我的日子寂寞不寂寞的时候，沈巍简直就想将他就地正法了。   下车的时候是扯着人下的。   赵云澜只穿了件T恤，被沈巍强硬地裹着大衣抱在怀里挪着在地下停车场往家走，这厮也没有乖乖听话，觉得堂堂一个大男人的被抱着走也太丢脸了，又想想有油不揩更待何时，顺着沈巍的西裤往下就探去。   摸了两把，摸出火来了。   还没走到停车场的入口，赵云澜就直接被一把按住在停车场的柱子后。   大理石柱凉得惊人，男人温热的气息打在他的后颈，赵云澜的手还插在他的西裤里，摸到的男根在一点一点地勃大，慢慢在手掌心变得炙热。   “我寂寞，”沈巍靠过来，赵云澜感觉到掌住的肉刃轻轻地顶了他一下，又忍不住摸了一把，被他抓住将手收了回去，这才想起刚刚的确问过他寂寞不寂寞这个问题：“阿澜，你要怎么消解我的寂寞？”   他的声音清冷而诱惑。   怎么消解？   赵云澜还在想着，裤子就已经被人扒了下来，他们站在暗处，身上也还裹着大衣，如果有人经过，怕也是很难看得到这藏在衣服下的旖旎情事。   沈巍的手绕过来，握住他开始兴奋起来的男根，濡湿的吻从耳根一路落到颈后，赵云澜被他蹭得正爽，迷迷糊糊又想起上次他后颈那块吻痕惹得整个调查处对他百般嘲笑的事，张口想叫他悠着点，沈巍的手却猛地顺着他男根上的经络一撸——   话还没说出口，在半途就活生生被拉成了呻吟，伴着喘息，不大不小地响在空旷的停车场，沈巍吸了口气。   他们有一段时间没有性事了，开过荤的人，一旦尝过了甜头，甚至都不用再撩拨，他自己的欲火就压不住了了。   勃起得更厉害了。   硬邦邦的男根嚣张跋扈地顶在他的股缝，赵云澜甚至都能感觉到他硕大的形状，比体温稍高一点的热，蹭在他臀部的皮肤上，那处热于是也一点一点地扩散开来。   与其说是热，倒不如是欲。   隐隐约约想起来上次在巷子里头没有做到最后，就是因为少了套。   “带……带了吗。”赵云澜说出口才惊觉自己嗓音里带着的沙哑，明明平时是个粗枝大叶的人，这个时候他倒开始操心这事了。   沈教授没有说话，有撕开包装的声音。   即使套子本来就带着润滑液，进入的时候还是会感觉到一点点的痛意，随着沈巍猛地将自己送进内里，那星点的不适也转换成了快感。   男根一插到底——   “额……”赵云澜自喉咙低低溢出一声喘息，感觉到沈巍的肉刃深深埋进菊穴，浑身都是一颤，还未缓过那劲来，男人已经扶着他的臀大开大合地操干起来。   沈巍不亏是在床上折腾过几番的人，撞击力度把握得恰到好处，隔着避孕套擦磨过内里的肉壁，顶端顶撞在他的穴的嫩肉，百般地研磨，待到他忍不住地想要自己套弄，又是狠狠的一记。   赵云澜浑身都绷紧，甚至连沈巍伸手去摸到他的大腿根时，还能感觉到他身体肌干发硬得厉害。想摸摸他叫他放轻松一点，男人却猛地一抖，内里颤巍巍地一夹——   “阿澜，”沈巍喘气，难得地在情事上开黄腔：“你是不是要夹死我。”   赵处长尚且浸在情事里，想回答他，又被狂猛的抽插顶得要上高潮，话还噎在喉咙里，身体已经被插得欲仙欲死……    沈教授……大概是想插死他吧？ *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Jingyan is playing with Zhanying's tits, pinching and pulling them just to feel his cock twitch in the convulsions of Zhanying's throat. His boyfriend is crying, snot running down his chin and over the stretch of his lips around Jingyan's cock.  It's a beautiful sight.   Jingyan licks his lips. Jerking his hips forward, he pushes himself an extra inch into Zhanying. "Breathe baby. Just breathe." He coos. Zhanying's spit bubbles and strings as he gags, tears running thick, face turning ruddy. Jingyan twists his fingers on Zhanying's nipples, milking him the way he knows he likes.  Zhanying's eyes roll back. Mouth going slack as he stiffens. Jingyan chuckles, looking down between Zhanying's thighs to see that he has made a mess of himself. Letting go, he pulls Zhanying off him. "Come on." He pushes at his shoulder. "Hold yourself open. I want to fuck you."  Zhanying blinks once, sniffing and rubbing the back of his hand over the mess of his face. Then, he lies back and spreads himself for Jingyan.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The gasps for air aren’t in pleasure anymore, They’re in fear, Link feels like he’s dying. His facade has been broken, His faith torn in two, After he forgot religion, And committed to sin, Alongside someone he thought he only considered a friend. When he opened his legs for him, And reached for him, Sought pleasure in his arms, His mouth, When in a moment of bliss he’d only thought of him, And not of any women. When he’d reached climax with his hands at his rim, With his cum inside of him, With his eyes glued to his, With no disgust, No regret, Only in love, An unholy version. Not recognised by church but by those like him, The ones that cast themselves to hell for the sake of soothing attraction, The ones born to sin. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*When Minako's ballet company has a rare trip to dance in the Soviet Union, Minako and Lilia study each other. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*It's not every day Minako can dance in Moscow. So she makes a study of it.  Makes a study of Lilia Baranovskaya. Of her graceful arms, so controlled, her poise, her instant command over any room she steps in.  Of the sounds she makes when they slip the handlers and Minako has her tongue against her clit. Of the lovely, strong arch of her back when she comes. Of the concentration in her dark eyes when she returns the favor, darker when Minako clenches around her fingers.  She breathes words of loveliness and elegance, and Minako hardly breathes at all.     Lilia is not a woman easily impressed. But Minako Okugawa impresses. She can do sweetness and subtlety, then leap into passion that demands attention. She has flexibility, she has strength, stamina, but more than that she has that rare charisma that Lilia cannot look away from.  She cannot look away when Minako dances, or when they talk, or when they find a narrow hiding place. Minako shows her passion, here, too, her tongue forcing even Lilia to writhe against the wall.  And when Minako comes, her bun falling apart, skirt hiked up, she is just as beautiful as on stage. *~*TEXT*~*

The towel he carried and the tone of his voice was too much for Carlos; he slammed the notebook closed and hurried after him.  Their clothes in a pile and the mirrors fogged up, they stood embracing as the hot water poured over them.  “Touch me, touch me.” Cecil panted into Carlos’s mouth as they kissed. Carlos obliged him, one hand moving down between them, grabbing hold of him and quickly bringing him to life.  “Anything else?” Carlos whispered as he stroked him.  “N-No, this is good.” Cecil moaned as he thrust into Carlos’s hand, his eyes closed and his head tilted back. Carlos quickened his speed, Cecil grunting and thrusting harder as he came.  “Don’t you need to get back to work?” Cecil asked Carlos as they lay together on the couch.  “It can wait.” *~*TEXT*~*

"Shit, leave the right one for me. I want to mark him too." Lin Shu says, guiding himself back into Zhanying's mouth.  Jingyan catches his eye, and it is a familiar gleam. A curl of competitiveness flares warm and low in his belly. "Make him come the most times?" Lin Shu smirks, teasing the tips of Zhanying's ears with his nails.  "You're on." Jingyan smiles serenely, pushing a finger into Zhanying. *~*TEXT*~*

He inhaled sharply, nasally voring all the oxygen in this establishment.   He took off his shoes, his toes wiggling vigorously and he was sweating terrifyingly. Arthas from world of warcraft opened his laundry basket, pouring his disgusting lich king clothes in the laundry washer, screaming so loud it could be heard from space.   Arthas flared his nostrils at the laundry. He closed the washer. He delicately caressed the button, it was a heavy load.   Invincible waltzed into the building and Arthas cried and sobbed and wheezed.   “Invincible, my fucking horse, I’m doing my laundry.” Arthas took off his lich king hat and picked his nose.   Invincible put his hand on Arthas’s shoulder reassuringly. “I’m disappointed in you Artas.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Bean *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*I hold the bean to my mouth. My tongue comes to lick the white indent. It drags up and down it's body, savoring the texture and flavor. My face feels hot as I pull away. I swallow, before opening my mouth. With shaky hands, I place the bean on my tongue. I close my mouth, and move it around. My heart is still beating as I graze my teeth across it length. I moan, before placing it on my molars. Once it's in position, I chomp down, exposing it's raw flavor. Again and again, I move my teeth, until it's crushed into bits. It feels grainy. It gathers in the back of my mouth. I use my tongue to find every piece, putting it all in one place. I swallow, and all at once they flood into my throat. They pierce and scratch at me. I swallow again, and I imagine each piece sinking lower into me. As the last one passes my throat, I cum. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*A pig.  That's what you have become.  A big, fat, pig.  Your gut is so full. You gave up on clothes months ago.  Pigs don't need clothes anyway.  You used to live life on your hands and knees, trailing behind your master with slow, plodding steps, ass jiggling as you moved, belly just brushing the floor.  But that's impossible now.  Your fat ass provides a cushion as you sit on the soft carpet. You haven't moved in months. You are completely immobile. Your massive belly pools in front of you, but you want more.  You always want more.  You pig.  As your master returns, you make grabby hands, thick fingers barely visible beneath the fat on your arms.   Your master has a gift for you.  The mask if settled over your mouth.  A thick liquid begins to pour down it.   You swallow and swallow and swallow.  You don't need to move.  You never need to move.  Soon you will be nothing more than a blimp of fat.  And yet, you are still hungry. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Carlos lay perfectly still as his boxers were slowly pulled down to expose him to the cold night air. A moan escaped his lips as a pair of strong hands began to knead and rub him, stopping every so often to part him, a finger tracing its way from his tailbone to his thighs, stopping to questioningly press at his most sensitive spot.   He nodded his consent, his heart racing as Cecil gently pushed his finger against him till he was in, letting Carlos adjust before he began to move it. As his pace and force increased, Cecil began to murmur soothingly to Carlos as he rubbed his back. Soon Carlos’s breath came in shallow pants, his back arching as the fire grew in his belly, his whole body spasming as Cecil drove him over the edge.  “Thank you.” Carlos murmured into Cecil’s neck.  Cecil kissed him in response, the two staring into each other’s eyes till they fell asleep. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*赵云澜闭着眼睛，他听到轻微的脚步声，走到他身前不远处，又停了下来。 他微微一笑，在床上撑起胳膊坐了起来。 “喂，你不会以为我眼睛瞎了......就不能满足你了吧。” 沈巍的身体瞬间压了上来，实打实的重量，将他猛地扑倒在了床上。 “不许胡说！"沈巍压低着声音，狠狠地威胁道。 赵云澜从喉咙发出一声愉悦的笑，然后将沈巍的衣领狠狠一揪：“那就......干我！” 没了视觉的干扰，周遭的一切变得更加敏感而暧昧。 赵云澜几近着迷地听着耳边来自沈巍的呼吸，粗重得像从喉咙深处发出，带着最幽暗的欲望，用力打在他的脸上，又沿着他的耳边来来回回。 赵云澜知道沈巍在看他，那目光有些烫，让赵云澜忍不住去想象镜片后那双被情欲熏染的眼，此刻该是怎样的深邃暗然，只因为自己。 这认知让赵云澜蓦地兴奋起来，皮肤一寸寸地起了战栗。 一只手轻轻摸上了赵云澜的眼皮，带着小心翼翼的颤抖。 赵云澜配合着眨了眨眼，一双不安分的手趁机顺着沈巍的衣摆摸了进去，一路下行抓住了他的硬挺。 入手很热，像是尚未完全苏醒，软绵绵地躺在赵云澜的手心。 他坏笑着撸了几把，如愿听到耳边的呼吸蓦地一窒，然后变得更加急促起来。 手中的阴茎开始快速地膨胀，赵云澜故意用大拇指划过那敏感的顶端，就听耳边传来近乎尖锐的急喘，带着一丝压抑的呜咽，沈巍的身体摩擦着他的狠命抖了几下。 “看来确实不用再跟你客气了。”沈巍的声音带上了情欲的沙哑，很有些咬牙切齿的狠劲。 说话间，他重重捏住赵云澜的下巴，对着那张嘴咬了上去。 黑暗之中，除了耳边交错的粗喘，只剩下彼此身体的探索。 滚烫的肉体毫无阻隔地贴在一处，传递着血脉间迸发的热情。 赵云澜仰头承受着沈巍舌尖的吸吮，下巴依旧被他捏着不能闭合。 他感受着沈巍的汗水一滴滴落在自己胸口，烫得像火，每一下都让他忍不住想要颤抖，而身下，沈巍的阴茎正在他体内肆意驰骋。 被黑暗放大的感官，让赵云澜清楚地感觉出后穴每一道被撑开的褶皱。 粗大的茎体带着灼热的脉动，一下下擦过他脆弱的内壁，带出酸爽交杂的煎熬。 他大张着腿环上沈巍的腰，身体配合着沈巍的冲撞不断起伏，迎着他每一次的撞击而上，好让他进得更深，又在他每一次后退时，收缩着后穴挽留。 水乳交融的默契逼出了沈巍前所未有的疯狂，他加快了挺动的频率，几乎是发了狠地死命撞，同时不可自控地看向了身下的爱人。 赵云澜正躺在一片深蓝之中，双手紧攥着身下揉皱的床单，身体因着沈巍每一下的撞击不住晃动。 他全身的肌肤已被情欲烧出大片的粉红，胸口小腹还沾着未知的莹白液体，在灯光下泛着艳丽的光。 赵云澜半闭着眼，呻吟从他被吻得红肿的唇瓣间肆意流出，又随着沈巍激烈的撞击，一次次被冲散成了细碎的高亢。 像是感受到了沈巍灼热的目光，他晃动着撑起上身，一双眼睛直直看向沈巍的方向，哑着嗓子断续道：“宝贝......啊......我那里......嗯......是.......是不是......干得.......嗯......很爽？” 如此说着，他缩起后穴就是一夹，激得沈巍受不住地高仰起头，低吼着又是猛力几下撞。 快感堆积得太过汹涌，沈巍皱着眉头压制着射精的欲望，赵云澜却在此时突地一笑，向着他的方向伸出了自己的手。 沈巍眼中紧盯着赵云澜的一举一动，刻意放慢了挺动的速度，慢慢握了上去。 相连处冲撞不停，赵云澜手上用力，扶着沈巍的手坐起了身。 然后他妩媚一笑，将沈巍的食指含进了嘴里，模仿着两人身下交合的频率，用温软的舌头舔弄起来。 十指连心，最是敏感。 指尖被温暖包裹，进出间的粉嫩小舌若隐若现，沈巍看得两眼发直，只觉得全身的热血瞬间涌向了身下，而身下那处容纳自己的湿热甬道像有无数开阖吸吮的小嘴，爽得无可复加。 沈巍的脸叫快感折磨得狰狞起来，他嘶吼一声，将赵云澜的双腿架到肩上，开始了大刀阔斧的最后冲刺。 这样的姿势让后穴的阴茎进得更深，配上沈巍富有技巧的挺动，很快让赵云澜彻底陷入了快感的晕眩，口中浪叫声声不断。 “太棒了......啊......” “对.......就是那里.....” “沈巍.......啊.......真......真他妈爽.......” 爱人的褒奖向来是男人最大的动力。 沈巍伸手将意乱情迷的爱人锁进怀里，更深地向下压进了他的身体。 高潮一瞬，赵云澜舒服得蜷起脚趾，失神间将指尖深深掐进了沈巍的手臂， 沈巍被他下意识收缩的后穴夹得舒爽无比，咬着牙又冲刺一阵，也跟着释放出了精华。 云雨收歇，两人喘息着并排躺在床上。 余韵中，沈巍怔怔看着头顶的灯光，就感觉赵云澜的手摩挲着握了上来。 “是不是没关灯？”他突然问了一句。 沈巍转头细细看了他片刻，反手将他的手收进了掌心，徐徐道：“放心，就算摸黑，你也能满足我。” 赵云澜闻言一愣，随即笑得在床上打了无数个滚，最后滚进了沈巍的怀里。 “你小子可学坏了！”赵云澜的爪子在沈巍的胸口不怀好意地游走了一番，又慢慢往上，最后摸上了沈巍的脸。 有点烫，赵云澜想，这人果然又脸红了。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Mikele在酒吧的人群中穿梭，今夜他不需要在酒吧里献唱。然而他并没有回家的心思，他的室友今天很忙，似乎是要在外面通宵了。  有个身影坐在吧台前。他看到有人上前去搭讪，他看到被搭讪的人报以玩味的微笑，他看到他对递过来的酒来者不拒，但是并没有为了任何人离开那个位置。他突然有了一探究竟的兴致，他绕开酒吧里来来往往的人们，慢慢走在那人身边。坐在吧台前的人喝完了手上酒杯里最后一口酒。在Mikele还未开口前就向调酒师要了两杯新酒——金色的酒液，在酒吧昏暗的灯光下似乎闪闪发亮。然后将就在Mikele惊讶的注视下将其中一杯推向了Mikele。  Mikele在他身边坐下，接过那杯酒。眼前人似笑非笑地看着他，举起他自己的那杯抿了一口。他的上衣领口很低，深色的布料衬得他皮肤愈发白了。Mikele的眼神有些专注地看着他喝下了那口酒，然后端起自己面前的那杯酒尝了一口。  “这个颜色很称你。”这是今晚他对Mikele说的第一句话，眼神清亮。  两人走向了洗手间，把酒钱留在了吧台上。  在刚才的词句交换中，Mikele得知对方叫Laurent。Mikele半开玩笑地问他这是否是真名。“真的，但真名与否真的重要吗？要是你想的话，你还可以叫我别的名字。”Laurent歪着他，又露出了那种似笑非笑的表情了。  “你说的对，那并不重要，特别是在这里。”金发的男人的指尖碰到了Laurent的手腕。“Laurent就很好。你叫我Mikele就可以了。”     洗手间隔间里的空间对于两个人来说并不充裕。两人在关上隔间门的那瞬间就亲吻了起来，动作甚至可以说得上是急切。当Laurent试图把舌头伸进Mikele的嘴巴里的时候，Mikele在张嘴回应他的同时把手伸进了Laurent的领口，恰到好处的力道让Laurent喘息。  两人的嘴分开时，他们的双手已经不约而同地伸向了对方的裤子。裤子很快就被解开了，两个男人掏出了对方已经有些抬头的阴茎撸动了起来。金发的男人吻着身材高大些的男人的脖子。 Mikele一只手摩挲着Laurent的腰，感受布料下紧实的肉体。Laurent紧紧挨着身前的男人，在快感中伸出舌头舔舐起了他的耳垂。在双方的套弄下，两人射在了对方的手中。Laurent在高潮的余韵中欣赏着Mikele泛红的脸颊，然后在他的耳尖印上了一个吻。  这个卫生状况有些堪忧的洗手间隔间显然不是做爱的理想地方，而两人也不满足于手活儿。在简短的交流过后，Mikele和Laurent快步走出了酒吧，步入了附近的爱情旅馆。  两人一进房间门就拉扯着对方的衣服想要将对方从衣服里弄出来，Mikele还不忘用脚带上了房门。从房门到床边，衣服掉了一路，但他们已经无暇顾及了。Laurent在仰面倒上床铺的同时用一双手臂环着Mikele的身子将他拉进了自己的怀里。  Mikele凑上Laurent的嘴唇给他了一个吻，Laurent欣然接受。金发的男人感受到身下的男人的身子开始放松，于是他试探性地摸上了身下人的大腿，Laurent会意，将那两条修长有力的腿张开，让Mikele进入他的两腿间。Mikele从床头柜中拿出润滑剂往手上倒了一些，然后将手指探入了Laurent的臀缝间，摸到了那隐秘的入口。Mikele一边亲吻着身下人的胸口，一边讲一根手指缓缓伸入了他的后穴。Laurent配合地将腿抬高，在Mikele用牙齿刮蹭着他的乳尖时发出了更加悦耳的呻吟。  “你很喜欢我这样玩你的乳头吗？”说着Mikele用力地吮吸了一下身下人的乳头，惹得Laurent呻吟得更响了。  随后Laurent露出了一个挑逗似的微笑，伸出柔软的舌头舔了舔自己的嘴唇，说道：“是啊，我喜欢。”  Mikele觉得自己更硬了，这时Laurent体内的手指已经增加到了两根。他的手指模仿着性交的动作抽插着，在甬道内分开又并拢，小心翼翼地扩张着。Laurent环着Mikele的脖子，吻着他的嘴唇、嘴角和脸颊，然后告诉Mikele他准备好了。Mikele有些担心，但是Laurent用低沉的声音说着“可以了”。于是Mikele将手指抽出了他的后穴，随后戴上了安全套，再将阴茎插入了Laurent的肉穴。虽然经过了两根手指的扩张，后穴依然紧致，这使阴茎的进入有些困难，Mikele和Laurent显然都不太好受。  正在Mikele犹豫着的时候，Laurent扶着Mikele的肩对他说：“来吧。”Mikele见Laurent如此坚决，便继续往里深入，一鼓作气一插到底然后没有过多停顿便抽动了起来，这使Laurent“啊”的一声叫了出来，而他的声音并不全然是难受而是有些满足的意味。Laurent喘息着对他说：“你还可以对我再粗暴一些。”然后想要证明些什么似的把双腿盘上了身上人的腰。  Mikele抽插的动作变得更加猛烈，Laurent把盘在他腰上得双腿盘得更紧了。他的肉穴也逐渐适应了阴茎的攻势，湿热的甬道收缩着包裹着它。Mikele一只撑着床面，另一只手揉弄着Laurent饱满的胸部的力道变得更大，他发现每当他掐住Laurent的乳尖的时候，Laurent的呻吟声就会高一些，这让他玩弄了好一会儿身下人的乳头，使它们又红又肿。  金发的男人的手放开了Laurent的乳头，然后向下抚弄起了他的阴茎，前液沾湿了Mikele的手指。Mikele把大部分阴茎抽出来，再用力地送进去，每当蹭过Laurent体内的敏感点的时候，Laurent的反应也愈加兴奋了。Laurent张开嘴呻吟着，在高高低低的呻吟声之间用很轻很轻的声音说：“爱我。”Mikele只看到Laurent张合的嘴唇，于是他低下头问Laurent刚才说了什么。Laurent摇摇头，然后把Mikele抱得更紧了一些。  Laurent仰头达到了顶点，精液溅在两人身上。他射精时，后穴和内壁收紧，差点让Mikele也射了。他再挺动了几下，Laurent突然抓起了Mikele刚才套弄他阴茎的手，将手引到唇边，接着伸出舌头舔弄了起来，直到把金发男人手上的精液舔尽。湿润的后穴的媚肉缠着阴茎的感觉，眼前画面感的冲击力和灵活的舌头舔在手上感觉，终于让Mikele低吼一声射了出来。  两人躺在床上，困倦的Laurent用脸蹭了蹭枕头，然后挨着Mikele进入了梦乡。Mikele有些无奈地看着迅速睡着的Laurent。他觉得这个叫Laurent男人肯定在他们做爱的时候说了什么而他没有听见，但是暂时他是没法把这个问题问出口了。Mikele叹了口气，然后伸手关了灯。     Fin *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It starts, as it always does, with Nia’s ring kit. Bethan has tried behaving, keeps trying to keep herself innocent, but she knows once the draft is over that will change. She will finally be getting into the ring, she will give herself to Nia before that...  Nia smiles, sensing the girl’s need and moving to whisper suggestions for what else they could do. The girl had smiled then, moving swiftly to disrobe them both and push Nia down onto the bed, moving herself over Nia’s face, letting out a definite gasp and moan as Nia teased her clit, keeping her innocent but also pleasuring her.   Nia had encouraged her to ride the light brushes of her lips and tongue over her clit and pussy, noting that the girl took to it easily, riding her like the end of the world was coming. When, finally, Bethan came undone it was with a scream, her entire body trembling as she adjusted herself, settling so her head was on Nia’s shoulder, panting weakly.  “Holy... fuck.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Nia... hey... woah...”  Bethan moves to pull Nia into a tight hug, keeping her from trying to tackle the other women as they left the ring, her grip tighter every time Nia tried to break free, only releasing once she had her backstage, keeping a tight grip on her wrist, dragging her into the showers, moving fast to strip them both, locking them into a shower which she quickly turned on, dropping easily to her knees, pushing Nia back against the wall of the shower, moving to latch onto Nia’s clit quickly, dragging a surprised moan from Nia, her frustration still clear even as she tangled her hands into Bethan’s hair, pulling the girl’s tongue and lips against her a little more, letting out a snarl as Bethan dared to push two fingers into her, working fast, emotion and desperation over-riding any and all fears she had. Nia had ridden both her tongue and fingers to a release, gripping Bethan’s shoulders as she fought to stay upright, quietly crying as she slid to the floor, wrapping Bethan in her arms.  “I love you... I’m sorry.”  “Shhh, I love you too.” *~*TEXT*~*

Severus shook his head. Draco said, "None for me. Put the plate down and come here."  Taking him literally, Harry plopped himself onto Draco's lap, eliciting a low chuckle from Severus.  "What do you want?"  "Hm." Draco pretended to consider the matter. "I'll tell you something. In my family, when I was a child, I always got to choose one present to open on Christmas Eve, rather than waiting until Christmas Day. I think it's a shame to give up these old traditions, don't you, Severus?"  "Oh, I agree completely." Severus pulled out his wand. "I see something that I'd quite enjoy unwrapping and opening, don't you?"  A very short time later, Harry was naked, with Severus's tongue working him open enthusiastically while Harry sucked Draco's cock. Harry grinned to himself. Holidays with his two lovers were better than anything he had ever dreamed of as a child at the Dursleys'. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"Shh… Wouldn't wanna interrupt anybody's studying, would we?"  A soft laugh from the low voice in his ear and a few agonizingly slow jerks draw out whispered pleas. Hanzo rubs desperately against him, whining like a dog until Jesse works his magic faster against the nub of his cock. The world blissfully unravels from below.  The blanket can't cover the looks on their faces when a shadow looms over the beanbag chairs.  "Really, guys? In the  library?"   If Genji fails his engineering final, they're both going to be in for a lot of pain - and not the kind they like. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Silent anarchy. It’s the only description she can imagine to express what’s happening. A revolution. Sublime chaos.   The heel of his hand is pressed against her mons exerting exquisite power and three of his graceful fingers are strumming a love song.  The motion of the car, its resonant throbbing beneath them adds to the pressure. Mulder is nonchalantly looking out of the rain-striped window as a storm brews inside her.   “Take the next left, ” Mulder tells the driver. “We’re almost home.”  She rocks and rolls. There’s a moment when the need to speak, to express her pleasure peaks but she bites into his neck, supressing the words, letting her pulsing grasp around his fingers tell the story.   The rain gushes against the car and the drone of the wipers punctuates the heavy silence. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Jimin was feeling really frustrated, the amount of times he had been bothered today was starting to get really annoying. It did not help that he was also highly frustrated /sexually/ therefore everything else was just adding to the flame. He wanted and NEEDED alone time, that way he could release all tension with a good jerk off session.  Jimin had a secret, his closet had a very nicely sized vibrating dildo taped to the wall, taped for security reasons, it was taped against the inside of his closet door which thankfully was a walk in so it had alot of space. He’d been already prepped, during his shower earlier which took a little too long, impatient as always, he just couldnt stop screwing himself onto his fingers, they were small but they got the job done. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*接下来繁忙的集训如期而至，大量的工作和训练，减重不难，最难的是增重。看了体测结果，岳明辉开始头疼，他没想到不仅是脂肪含量低，连肌肉含量也掉得这么厉害，当其他人开始“轻松”的减脂期，他却提前步入增肌的环节。  岳明辉看着自己盘子里的八个蛋清皱了皱眉，干巴巴的菜色让他觉得有些反胃。但难得四个人能一起吃饭，看着埋在碗里的三个小脑袋，他决定坐下来再塞两口。  “岳妈妈，你挑食！”  “不是，我……还没吃完呢！”  灵超的话成功引起了另外两个人的注意，卜凡抬起头，看了眼他的盘子又抬头盯着岳明辉，那种“肃杀”的眼神儿说瞪也不为过。  岳明辉激灵了一下，收到了卜凡的“警告”马上埋下头，硬塞了两口鸡蛋，却被噎得后背发麻，他只得无奈起身。  “我去厨房拿点喝的，你们都谁要？”  厨房和饭厅隔了一个小走廊，中间的半面磨砂玻璃让厨房形成了一个半封闭的空间。岳明辉慢慢走向厨房，最近凡子对他好像又恢复如常，虽然私下依旧冷着脸，但至少不再躲着自己。思及此处，他不禁开始嘲笑起自己，是什么时候开始他对“正常”的定义已经低到这样的程度？  打开冰箱门的一瞬间，冷气扑面而来，让结束训练浑身是汗的人抖了一下。岳明辉缩着肩膀，快速在冰箱里翻找着矿泉水或者是能量饮料，不料却被纳入一个宽大的怀抱，身后的大手在平坦的胸腹来来回回的游走。  “洋洋，别，他们还在外面呢……”  岳明辉见挣脱不开，便侧着头望向饭厅的方向，两个高大的身影背对着厨房坐着，几乎被磨砂玻璃完全挡住，他不由的松了口气。午间的练习区空无一人，老师和工作人员正在休息，现在空荡荡的厨房只剩他和木子洋。  “切，老岳，你怎么补了这么多天，一点长进都没有，还是硬得像块搓衣板。”  嘴上虽抱怨，木子洋环着小骨架的岳明辉，刚刚好能把他包进怀里，这种奇异的体验感让他内心多了一份欲望。     木子洋突然把脸凑近了了他的脖颈，炽热的气息喷撒在颈侧，在冰凉的空气的刺激下岳明辉不禁缩了缩脖子闭起了眼。见状耳边传来一声轻笑，长手就越过了他的肩膀，稳稳的端起了冰箱里的一盆樱桃。  “呵呵，老岳，你刚刚想什么呢？耳朵都红啦。”  岳明辉没管木子洋的调笑，叹了气取出了自己要的东西就要往会走，木子洋却死死的挡住了他的去路。  “老岳，吃樱桃吗？”  “不了，我今天的食谱里没有这个，我……唔”  没等他说完，木子洋的嘴唇便附了上来。他舔了几下岳明辉的嘴瓣，便轻易的打开了他的牙关，一颗冰凉的樱桃被灵巧的舌头推了进来。  樱桃圆溜溜的，随着木子洋的激烈搅动，欢快的在岳明辉的口腔里跳动。岳明辉即要应付木子洋的灵舌又要顾及翻滚的樱桃，来不及吞下的涎液溢满了口腔。木子洋突然按住了他的后脑，对着嘴唇狠狠一吸，被搅破樱桃的汁水和涎液一起被吸入木子洋的口中。  木子洋抹了抹唇角，满足的笑了起来，“这樱桃和着哥哥一起吃可真甜～”     说着他意犹未尽的含着下一颗樱桃吻了上去……  岳明辉被吸得嘴唇红肿脑子缺氧，只能乖乖的站在那，任由木子洋将一颗颗的送樱桃进来。多余的樱桃核被木子洋的灵舌卷了出去，口腔里溢满了香甜液体混合了二人的津液，甜蜜可口。     木子洋吃够了樱桃，他慵懒又满足的声音再次响起来。  “那既然哥哥吃了我的樱桃，那我也要吃哥哥的。”  说罢不等岳明辉反应，上衣就被掀起。右侧的乳头被舌头卷入了温暖的口腔。木子洋蹲在他身前，手固定住岳明辉的腰，让他动弹不得。磨砂的玻璃刚巧挡住了这一切，只能露出岳明辉微微后仰的脖颈和咬着唇极力忍耐的脸。  “啊哈～”  一番舔弄后，木子洋尖细的牙齿咬上了泛红的乳晕，嘴上也用力的吮吸，反复玩弄让他的乳头又胀大了一圈，就连淡色的乳晕也肿胀起来。木子洋的舌头在胀大的乳头上打着圈，满意的品尝着他的果实。突然他一口咬了上去，尖细的牙齿在红缨上轻轻的研磨。  “啊～洋洋，停下来。”  敏感点受到这样的刺激让他头皮发麻，胸口又痛又痒，他难耐的扭动着身子，在欲望的牵引下，他挺着胸脯，想把更多送入他的口中。  另一侧被冷落的乳头很快也受到了照顾，在修长的手指细心捻动下，也颤抖的挺立起来。大掌包裹住胸前薄薄的肌肉用力的揉弄，胸口很快变得一片绯红，乳头和乳晕在毫不留情的玩弄下红肿发胀。木子洋很快脱离了被吸到麻木的一侧，张口去安抚另一边。     “唔，停下呐～”  两侧的胸口在大力的吸弄下，可怜得肿得老高。刚被吐出来的一侧，完全凸起的前端正散发着水亮的光泽。忍住直冲头顶的快感，岳明辉利用最后一丝理智伸手去推木子洋的头，胸口却被报复性的咬了一口。  “嗯，痛”  他双腿颤抖，眼角溢出了点生理的泪水，闭上眼，忍受着一波又一波的快感。     下午的舞蹈课，卜凡不时的瞟着岳明辉不自然鼓胀的胸口，那人鼻尖红红的，整个下午都显得手忙脚乱。每每抬起手臂，衣料擦过胸口，都引得那人一阵轻颤。卜凡看向木子洋，果然那人的视线一直黏在岳明辉身上，不时露出满足的微笑。  哼，变态…… *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*   “真的要玩吗？”趴在床上的恋人呼吸愈发粗重，他调整了一下遮住半张脸的黑色口罩点点头嗯了一声，氧气限制中的漫长前戏已经让光一热出了汗，口罩边缘的肌肤也渐渐晕开层不明显的薄红。这种程度在平常锻炼中其实不算什么，他也像先前一样努力的调整呼吸来保持一定程度的吸气顺畅，但现在的情形显然和做俯卧撑以及普通的健身不是一个级别，跪趴着被插进去的时候光一还是乱了节奏紧紧地抓住床单。    “中档上次戴了多久？”他慢慢动了几下，扶住他的腰一只手探到面罩前将档位拨高一阶，空气阻力愈发明显，光一忍着体内抽插的快感在氧气流失中闷闷的回答:“一个多小时…”  “还不错嘛…中高档能坚持30分钟吗？”  “应该吧…嗯……”稍微适应后他往后贴了贴示意刚可以继续动作，这次才进去几分钟身体就已经变得黏热潮湿，赤裸身体上渗出的薄汗在暖色灯下隐约可见，堂本刚仔细观察着他的反应开始有意识的往能让他舒服的地方顶，身体比以往做的时候还要紧绷，即使前戏做的很充分后穴也足够湿软，但呼吸受阻中肌肉反射性紧张还是限制了动作的幅度，阴茎在肉穴里摩擦的快感并不亚于平时，仅仅是九浅一深的缓慢抽插就逐渐逼出了光一情难自禁的呻吟，做爱中一向很能自我调节的人在刚开始就败下阵来呼吸混乱，胸膛也在堂本刚故意加快速度抽插时起伏不止，他拨开光一后颈的碎发吻上他的脖子，嘴唇停留在汲取氧气时加速伏动的颈侧轻轻舔了舔，环在腰上的手又收紧了一些把他往怀里圈的更牢，保持着绝对占有的姿势不再客气地直接操上了前列腺，持续几十次的激烈动作中光一受不住的扬起下巴从喉咙里发出一串颤音，强烈快感中勉力维持的呼吸险些被隔绝，他浑身颤抖的跪在床上身体往下沉，攥着床单的手无意识的收紧拉扯，支撑身体的双腿紧绷到轻微痉挛，汗也流的越来越多，无法言喻的双重刺激爽到湿润的眼睛涌出了眼泪，痛苦模糊呻吟声中掺杂着更多道不明的极乐。  堂本刚每次凶猛的持续操弄后都会停下几秒亲吻他的脊背给他缓缓神，喘不上气的折磨总能在抽送中变成让人无所适从的强烈快感，口罩旋钮又被调高一档，稀薄的氧气还在不断流失，磨人的呻吟和时不时的抽泣也受到了阻碍，他红着眼眶发不出连贯的声音只能不停的流眼泪，刚扳过他的脸舔掉了眼睫附近的晶莹液体，反方向调节后贴在他耳边温柔的安抚:“深呼吸…别说话，五秒后我会调最高档。”  “唔…嗯……”体质果然很好，露在外面的小半张脸在轻微窒息中肉眼可见的涨红，身体在操干中总是处于紧张状态，再加上不断被顶着前列腺，好几次差点把他插到高潮，自己或许还没有意识到铃口不断流出的水已经弄湿了小片床单，就连阴茎勃起都比以往还快。五秒的时间只能稍微缓和一点，阻氧面罩慢慢递增到最高档，光一艰难的呼吸愈发急促起来，他转过头红着眼眶无措的看向刚，身后的男人咬着他耳朵往里动作了几下，坚定的眼神里写满了安抚，光一漂亮的腹肌沁了层汗，在抽插动作变快时不规律的一起一伏，刚抚摸着他的胸膛把人搂在怀里低喘着下了床，沙哑的嗓音染上些情欲和几分小心的谨慎:“换个姿势…有点想欺负你……”  “呜嗯…嗯…”拉开窗帘后直接被按在了窗户上，轻微窒息中站立姿势相比跪趴能稍微让他舒服点，故意不选旁边的墙壁而选择落地窗的确是在欺负人，考虑到光一的极限也就不再给他多余的时间适应，刚从后面用力捂着口罩尽可能快而狠的顶上前列腺，比以往还要紧的后穴让他忍不住舒服的哼了几声，尽管如此还是紧张细心的观察起光一的状态。  原以为停了的雨这时却下的更急，雨水拍打在玻璃上模糊了外面的景色，光一在氧气的加速流失中急促地喘息，趴在玻璃面上的身体轻微搐动，胸膛前所未有地剧烈起伏，浑身高度紧绷的状态下后穴被操弄的快感成倍翻腾，再加上大脑缺氧，没过多久就让他濒临高潮。不断流出的前列腺液蹭在玻璃上，光一汗湿的手指紧贴着光滑的窗户，时不时因过度用力而发出吱吱的摩擦声响，他喘不上气的挣扎着，没撑稳时手掌打滑在玻璃面上留下几条湿痕，窒息中的高潮前兆激烈到让人欲生欲死，光一流着眼泪紧紧抓住按在他面罩上的手拼命摇头，奋力挣扎间发出模糊不清的呜咽，操干中痉挛愈发强烈，急剧跳动的心脏似乎下一秒就会戛然而止，察觉到光一逐渐忘记了呼吸，堂本刚在绞紧的甬道里用力冲刺着把失去神智的人操的抽搐着射了出来，在光一快要昏阙时松开手调低阻力迅速摘掉了口罩，他捏着光一的下颌迫使他仰头抬起下巴让氧气能够顺畅的吸入，一边抚摸着他的胸膛一边在他耳边一声声的引导  “光一…呼吸…”  高潮的余韵持续了很久，意识朦胧中光一胡乱射了好几次，干净的玻璃狼藉一片，与外面冲刷而过的透明雨水相衬，结束时他的眼神涣散眼角含有泪花，呻吟和剧烈的喘息声在口罩摘掉后充斥了整个房间，遮住许久的脸颊红的发烫，微张的唇也是湿润的，嘴角还有失神状态中流下的涎水。刚把他抱在怀里等他缓过神，尽管插在里面的东西好几次有了射精欲望也没敢继续动。等到光一终于正常的开始呼吸时才松开抬着他下巴的手颇不满的重新把人按在了落地窗上。  “好过分啊…搞得我这么紧张。”  “差点以为要死掉了…”  “太狡猾了…让我做这种事——”  “我绝对不会再做第二次了……”     “好啦…别哭嘛，只是想试试而已…下次不会了。”光一不经意间察觉到肩膀上的一片潮湿，反应过来后立马低声下气的哄。不负责任的让刚陪自己玩这么危险的游戏，心里其实是确定了刚不会伤害到他才敢这样放纵……却不想最后吓到了他，自己好像…有点太任性了。  “我都没敢射…”他重新开始了动作，把软着身子的人钉在窗户上用力操了几下，边操边抓着光一的手沾了点先前射在上面的液体抹在他汗湿的胸膛上  “明明光一射了这么多…比外面还多…”  “哈…嗯……胡说什…怎么可能…有外面多…啊嗯……”  “我说有就有…湿漉漉的，射个不停…”  “叫的比雨声还大…还能再大点嘛…我生气了，只有听光一的呻吟才能心情变好…”  “啊、啊……你…”  “光一今天能高潮几次？可以自慰然后把我夹射吗？”  “不是喜欢刺激的吗，自慰啊，换个地方就不行了？”他握着光一的手套弄起那根射了几次还在半硬的阴茎，插在里面的东西顶在前列腺上偶尔碾过，光一知道自己今天玩的有些过火，即使身体处于极度敏感的状态还是听话的咬着唇在落地窗前撸起了逐渐硬挺的性器，低沉的喘息随着手上加快的动作愈发急促起来，高潮前察觉到了甬道的收缩反应，堂本刚坏心眼的在他射出来时狠狠撞了几下敏感点，光一带上哭腔的呻吟被顶的支离破碎，肉穴在刺激中绞紧了胀大的性器硬生生把他夹的射了出来。     被灌满后光一终于软了腿站不住脚，他靠在刚身上讨好的蹭了蹭，脸颊也因自慰的羞耻而红了大半，堂本刚叹了口气搂着他重新倒回床上面对面抱在了一起，光一还有些水蒙蒙的眼睛直溜溜盯着刚看，对视时又有些别扭的躲闪，几番下来后刚忍不住在那张红通通的脸颊上狠狠亲了一口  “卖萌禁止。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Sam’s fingers are entwined with Jessica’s, pining her hands down the mattress. Not that Jess has any intentions to wiggle away anyway. More than Sam’s hands and more than her knee rubbing her crotch, it’s her voice that takes away her will to flip Sam over and top her.  “Jessica,” Her lips graze the scar on Jessica’s cheek, making her shudder  “Jessica, Jessica, you’re beautiful you know that?”  Jess giggles breathlessly as an answer, unable to form coherent sentence.  “You’re so pretty, pretty… God, your skin’s so soft, it’s unbelievable…” Sam’s kisses trail down her jaw, to her collarbone, where the scars of the slashes Jess once got are sensitive enough to make her nails dig in the back of Sam’s hands. “You’re so hot, it should be illegal.”  That’s what throws Jess over the edge. The takes a sharp breath, hips buckling- Sam keeps whispering sweet nothing in her ears.   Jessica loves every second of it.  “Sam,” she eventually manages to whispers “I love you. I love you so much.”  Sam laughs, rolling next to Jessica and wrapping her arms around her.  “I know.” She kisses her temple. “I love you too.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The venue had been stifling, the air dense and stale.  The ride to the hotel, all five of them hidden away in the back of a van, had been humid and sticky. Heat rolled off the streets in waves on the way into the building, sticking their shirts to their backs with sweat.  Rain turned to steam on the sidewalks.  But Harry, with his arms wrapped around Louis’s neck and his back arching off the mattress.  With his stomach muscles quivering and tensing.  With his body pulling him in and pulsing around him.  Nothing compares to the heat of Harry. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*《秋葵和棒棒糖》     黄少天讨厌所有口感滑溜溜黏糊糊的食物，所以他讨厌吃秋葵。小时候讨厌到吃一口就想吐出来，长大了也仅仅能做到勉强咽下去并坚决不会吃第二口。除了秋葵之外，他还讨厌藕粉以及煮熟的银耳，不喜欢刻意勾芡的菜和汤。     在蓝雨夺冠，黄少天开始接到一些代言活动之后，俱乐部会要求他们保持个人形象，总之就是活的稍微精致一点，不要每天用凉水泼一下脸就算完事了，不然偶尔长个痘痘什么的，化妆师也很心累。于是黄少天曾经买过一款洗面奶，据说是无刺激无添加的敏感配方，本来他去卖化妆品的地方逛就觉得很羞耻，所以导购推荐了一句，他就赶紧买完回宿舍了。     回去之后他发现这个洗面奶的质地正是自己最讨厌的那一种，倒出来的液体就像是秋葵里挤出来的汁。他用了两回就忍不了了，转而回家的时候随便从自己亲妈的囤货里挑了一只，结果因为随手一抓就拿了个最贵的，只好随后斥巨资买了个贵妇牌套装赔罪。     和叶修在一起之后，由于叶修做西红柿炒鸡蛋居然勾芡，发生了两人同居之后第一次拌嘴。叶修表示从小家里人就这么做，他吃着顺口，黄少天表示这是异端，比到底是应该加糖加盐加葱花加香菜的问题还要严重。     叶修自然不会特地和黄少天对着干，他曾经听黄少天详细的控诉过很多次秋葵丧心病狂的口感，尤其是自从粉丝们都知道他讨厌吃秋葵之后，他收到的礼物里反而有很多秋葵零食。     太多了吃不完，叶修也不幸被强塞过一些，他对这种蔬菜没什么特殊的情绪，不喜欢也不讨厌。     某天晚上做床上运动之前，两个人推推搡搡的脱着衣服。叶修也解了睡裤的腰带绳，一抬头见黄少天凑上来说，想试试给叶修口一下。叶修惊得不行，问黄少天是不是偷摸看GV了，这么刺激。毕竟两人的床上运动一直很和谐，早已摸清了彼此喜欢的和不喜欢的。黄少天曾经吐槽过某种液体让他想到秋葵藕粉洗面奶，总之很讨厌，他怀疑自己会很煞风景的吐出来。所以还从没试过，不知道今天怎么突然来了兴致。     黄少天说，我很好奇，非常好奇。     他没说出来的是，他好奇的是叶修把持不住的样子，说白了就是想使坏。叶修把黄少天按在床上啃了一通，最后问他是不是来真的，黄少天二话不说，就顺手扒了叶修的内裤。叶修的小兄弟一下子弹了出来，早就精神的不行。     黄少天揉了揉脸，给面部肌肉做了一下扩张运动，把叶修看的心惊胆战，说你这架势，我怕你给我咬断。     啧咬断了小爷我的XING生活怎么办？虽然你器不大可是活好啊，我可是很珍惜的。黄少天说着垃圾话，低下头，又做了一遍心理建设，然后轻轻的舔了一下。     叶修一哆嗦，说你是不是故意的，黄少天一看，彻底来劲了，说老叶你好敏感啊哈哈哈哈。     废话，要是不敏感我就要去嗑蓝色小药丸了。叶修靠在床头，不知道说点什么好，因为他发现黄少天这是玩心大起，等着看自己出洋相。     叶修对自己的持久力较为有自信，但是经不住黄少天故意撩他。尤其是这画面太有冲击力，他眼睁睁看着黄少天张嘴含住大半，开始一下一下的吞吐。最过分的是黄少天一直看着他，挤眉弄眼的。     叶修此刻很想把自己的小兄弟拔出来，然后把黄少天按在床上狠狠干。可是黄少天正沉迷调戏叶修，挑战底线。没两下叶修就忍不住坐直了身子，扶住了黄少天的头顶，他甚至能看见晶亮的唾液顺着黄少天的嘴边流出来。黄少天当下的姿势也很限制级，把叶修看的口舌发干。     要论技巧，黄少天真的不怎么擅长，但可能因为两人第一次玩这一步，新鲜感带来的快意是翻倍的。很快黄少天就顾不上观察叶修的表情，他能感到嘴里的东西又大了一圈，而自己的下身也急需抚////慰，他忍不住一边含一边帮自己撸了几下。     叶修的手指已经缠住了黄少天的头发，口腔的温度和唇舌的刺激让他大脑空白，黄少天勉强吞咽着口水，喉咙的收缩惹得叶修周身一颤。他一下子按住了黄少天的肩膀让他松口，没戴套的前提下，他要是射出来就真的太刺激了。但可能觉得是自己主动提的，不做到最后有点对不起叶修，黄少天嗯了两声，舌头又在马眼上转了一下。     这回叶修真的是头皮一炸，一下子就射了。     黄少天没有经验，狠狠的呛到了。液体的味道和口感都让他有点反胃，瞬间就变得很狼狈。叶修赶快抱了床头的纸巾盒子过来，拽了两张接在黄少天的面前让他快点吐出来。黄少天咳了好几声，抹了抹嘴，说晚了，刚刚呛了一下就直接咽下去了。     叶修自己爽归爽了，看黄少天这样还是心疼。说我给你倒杯水去，黄少天摇头说不用，我去卫生间冲一冲。     过了一会儿回来了，这么一闹，黄少天都觉得自己萎了。他蔫蔫的爬上床靠着叶修，任由对方一下一下的撸自己的脑袋。     叶修说你怎么那么想不开。     黄少天一翻身，长腿搭到叶修的腰上蹭，越蹭越往下，叶修又不可避免的起了反应。     既然这么主动，不狠狠的把人办了叶修都觉得自己受到了侮辱，他用力亲了黄少天一下，把人肩膀往下一推，就打算执行制裁。     黄少天顺势仰躺，弯着膝盖还在蹭叶修的关键部位。     叶修俯身下来挠他痒痒，黄少天笑着一打滚，把叶修的脖子往下一拽。     说，我原先都没怎么观察过你爽的时候的表情，现在看过了，我都想反攻了怎么办？     叶修说你这个想法很危险，你不如展开讲一讲。     黄少天一本正经，说老叶你真是我见犹怜，真想让你在我身下辗转承欢。     叶修差点没给吓死，一脸惊叹的看着他。     黄少天瞬间笑的前仰后合，说哈哈哈哈哈哈这是我之前看的粉丝写的小说。     笑着笑着又吻到一起，叶修攻城略地，黄少天很快就笑不出来，开始喘气。     叶修也不知道怎么突然有了一个欠揍的念头，挨着黄少天的耳朵问，所以秋葵好吃，还是哥的棒棒糖好吃？     黄少天啊呜一口咬在叶修胳膊上，说秋葵味棒棒糖！难吃！拒绝！     叶修嘴角一弯，就要往下探，黄少天紧张的弓起后背，说你你你你干什么？     “我啊，吃根少天味儿棒棒糖，怎么，有意见？”     END. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*这并不是一个蜻蜓点水的纯情之吻，黄少天如同阿黄附体，像条小狗一样的咬着叶修的嘴，又笨拙的探出舌头，努力想要挤进牙缝钻进口腔，和抽烟的人接吻会发现他们的嘴里满是苦味，黄少天扯着叶修的领子，丝毫不惧那股津液里交叠的苦丝丝。他上次摔在叶修身上，留在叶修脸上的牙印子花了一点时间才褪去，这次在叶修嘴唇上留下的伤口，不知道要多久才能结痂脱落，嘴里有血味和烟味，叶修半边身子还在车外，他无处着力，硬是被黄少天搂着脖子啃了半天。最后他终于瞅准一个空当，把少年从他身上拉了下去，黄少天喘着粗气，一双眼睛从未如此的亮过。     好像里面有眼泪一样。     叶修一把甩上副驾驶的门，绕到另一侧坐上了自己的驾驶位。他拿出烟盒，想了想又扔掉，不小心按到喇叭，两个人都吓了一跳。最后终于冷静下来，他用手背擦了一把嘴，看到那里蹭上两条血痕。     他单方面的冷静没有任何用处。     黄少天像是一个打架打昏头的人，三昧真火烧到天灵盖，把所有的理智抓到一起捆成炮仗，由他自己一把火给点着了。叶修见他先是飞快的蹬掉自己脚上的鞋子，之后开始脱上衣，T恤的布料往上卷到一半，叶修果断出手，把那半截卷下去的再扯下来，把露出来的都遮回去。黄少天依旧不放弃，趁着叶修探身过来按他，一只手摸上叶修的裤裆，叶修倒吸一口凉气，就见眼前的小孩儿示威似的抿着嘴，手下动作不断，明显是不把他搞硬就决不罢休。     他始终认为自己对黄少天的感情的表露，没有明显到需要遮掩的地步，所以他也根本没有试图回避。可他忘了计算当事人过于敏感的情况，又或者是，忘了计算他根本不是单方面暗恋的情况。     他自以为演了一出一厢情愿的苦情戏，到头来却是个不解风情的白痴。     舔着嘴唇上黄少天留下的伤口，叶修意识到自己的下半身已经起了某种无法避免的反应，一个正常的男人，正面临着自己喜欢的人摸自己的情况，如果还不起反应那说明他有XING功能障碍。再看黄少天得意的小表情，叶修必须得说一句：果然小孩儿就是小孩儿。这句话还有另一层意思，就是小孩儿到底未经人事，撩他的同时，自己的内裤里也支起了小帐篷。     火都点上了，不灭火就说不过去了。     他拉住黄少天搁在自己裤裆上的那只手，固定住不让他有丝毫动弹的可能，另一只手扯住黄少天的内裤边往下一拽，直挺挺的XING器弹出来，顶端湿漉漉的。叶修直接将手掌裹上去，还没撸两下，黄少天就没了力气，自觉松了手，顾不上撩拨叶修，只剩下喘气的力气。叶修把刚才咬他一嘴血的小朋友按在座椅背上，他车上的后座早就拆掉，空出后备箱放货用了，前边自然是不方便，手脚放在哪里都别扭，可也没有办法。     况且他没打算做到最后。     手上动作没坚持多久，黄少天就缴械投降，射了叶修满手。叶修扯了几张纸巾擦干净，又拿了另外几张要给黄少天擦，被黄少天一把夺过去，继而背过身去自己解决了。黄少天精瘦精瘦的，背稍微一弓就显出两块肩胛骨，叶修看着他暗搓搓的给自己擦来擦去，再加上满嘴血味还没散掉，被撩起来的火灭了一半。     他捡起黄少天丢到脚下的衣服，抖平了放在他腿上。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*下面被揉弄，另一只手也钻进T恤里抚摸，随着身后人的动作，疲惫的身体完全被掌控。岳明辉的手扶上旁边的更衣柜，支撑着疲软的身体，快感袭来，他咬着下唇仰起头，脆弱敏感的耳朵和脖颈完全暴露出来。     身后的人一声轻哼，鼻间炽热的气息凑了上来，湿软的舌头裹住小巧的耳垂，舔弄起冰凉的耳钉。濡湿感扫过耳廓，直接钻进耳洞里。     “嗯啊～凡子”  久未经事的身体格外敏感，凡子之前的冷漠和他这份不同往常的温柔爱抚让他的身体兴奋的颤抖着。身体从上到下都掌控在凡子的手中，如潮水般的快感从虚软的身体里用上来，原来性事上凡子也可以这样温柔。  卜凡攥住眼前人的肩膀，那人刚刚淋过浴，香香软软的触感让他昏了头。他一边暗骂自己，一边用力把人翻了过来“咚”的一声抵在墙上。果然没有收到丝毫的反抗，他皱着眉抬起岳明辉的脸。眼前的人好像知道自己要做什么一样，顺从的仰起头，微微张开他干涩苍白的嘴唇。卜凡只觉得脑子里轰的一声，捏起他的下巴吻了上去，卜凡不想承认，自己真的想他了……  岳明辉闭着眼，尽力配合着卜凡在唇舌间的翻搅。刚刚突然转身，手肘和头部直接撞在了墙壁上，脑子依旧有点发懵，吻便附了上来。卜凡的吮吸毫无章法，让他浑身发麻，激烈的榨取着他胸腔里的氧气。头部和肩膀被大手牢牢的固定住，让他无处闪避，透明的津液从口中流下来，划出一道透明的线。  直到他觉得快要窒息时，凡子不舍的离开他的唇舌。刚穿好的裤子连同内裤一起被退去，松松的堆在脚踝，被爱抚到挺立的性器暴露在空气中。  卜凡内心一动，又将还没站稳的人给翻了过去，抓住岳明辉的双手撑在墙上。岳明辉的身子一僵，叹了口气，还是咬咬牙挺起了臀部。     丰满的两瓣臀肉就在眼前，敏感的泛着淡淡的粉色。卜凡大手抓着两瓣臀肉像两边掰开，隐藏在里面的小穴暴露了出来。  卜凡仔细端详着小穴，淡色的穴口紧闭着，他用指甲刮过小穴的褶皱，引得身前人一阵颤抖。卜凡心情舒畅了一些，小穴很干净也没有肿胀，一看就是有段时间没使用过的样子。他轻轻按压着小穴，想把指尖送进去，但紧闭的穴口推拒着他的指尖，让他寸步难行。看到这情形卜凡只能作罢，如果强制进去，别说下午的训练，估计哥哥走路都有困难。  岳明辉并不知道卜凡的打算。他扶着墙，额上渗着汗，极力的喘息着想要放松身体，他配合着身后人的动作挺动臀部，为了让小穴可以打开，他不想扫了弟弟的兴致，尤其是这次。  注意到了岳明辉的举动，卜凡无奈的笑了笑，“诶，哥哥，你不会真的打算，用后面侍候我？就现在？”  调笑的语气让岳明辉羞红了脸，他转过身看向卜凡，他依旧衣冠楚楚，双手抱胸，笑着看向自己。他赤裸着下身，腿间的分身还挺立着，样子狼狈不堪。  卜凡对着赤裸的哥哥说着荤话，第一次在哥哥温和的脸上见到这种羞愤难当的表情，他只觉得下身更硬了。  “哥哥，既然你这么想要，不然你就用上面那张嘴吧。”     岳明辉震惊的看向卜凡，他不相信这样的话竟然出自弟弟之口，以往不管是误解或是质问，都没有这样的言语能刺进自己的心，他黯然的低下头 ，看着弟弟运动裤里鼓出的一大块形状，心里一横，便还是认命的走了过去。  裤子被颤抖的手褪了下去，卜凡的巨物便弹了出来，炽热的雄性气息瞬间占据了鼻腔，岳明辉闭了闭眼，跪在他身前，伸出小舌张口就含了进去。  身上人传来一声舒服的叹息，哥哥的口腔异常温暖，和紧致的后穴不同，口腔更加柔软，还有柔软的灵舌，在柱身来回滑动。他扶着自己的分身，垂着眼细密的睫毛在眼下投出一片阴影，认真吞咽的表情，看得他更硬了几分。  卜凡很是享受，但岳明辉动作却格外吃力。凡子太大了，他极力张着嘴，却只能吞进了一个头。他用嘴唇包住牙齿，舌头卖力的舔弄表面的脉络。凡子的气味充斥着口腔，吞吐着巨物，呼吸逐渐变得困难。  在他卖力的舔弄下，嘴里的巨物一圈圈涨大却丝毫没有释放的前兆。岳明辉觉得下颚已经不是自己的了，过多的津液从无法闭合的口里流出，弄得下巴脖颈黏糊糊的一片。卜凡不耐烦的按了按他的后脑勺，巨物瞬间又挺近了几分，直探向他的喉咙。  喉咙被抵住，岳明辉抑制不住的想干呕，激得口腔和喉头一阵收缩，突如其来的刺激让卜凡不可控制的的发出了舒服的轻哼。岳明辉见这样有用，干脆双手抓住卜凡的胯，向前一用力，卜凡的巨大便更深的顶住了喉咙。强烈的干呕感使他难受得浑身颤抖，他只是闭着眼不管不顾的卖力的吞咽着巨物。     很快卜凡被极大的快感笼罩，分身也突突的跳了起来，这是射精的前兆。卜凡把住岳明辉的头，在他的口腔里冲刺起来，在岳明辉被撞得头晕眼花时，终于感觉到嘴里的巨物一阵颤抖，接着腥咸滚烫的液体便灌进了喉咙，烫得被使用过渡的猴头火辣辣的痛。  释放过的卜凡终于放开了他，岳明辉伏在地上大口喘息着，他脸颊绯红，双目还含着生理的泪水，过量的精液顺着嘴角流下来，样子格外色情。在一番折腾中，他的分身也软了下去，安静的垂在腿间，竟然看起来有点可怜。  看着地上的人，卜凡按按突突跳的太阳穴，内心苦笑，他们的关系好像又回到了原点，他到底怎样才能摆脱这个人…… *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*03（含Blue/Owen成人向内容）  Owen先是听到奇怪的声音，他睁开双眼，发现自己正置身于一个森林，侧躺着，腰上传来的不可思议的触感让他不由得回过头，去看是谁用尖利的东西束缚住了自己。 然而看清是谁后，他只得倒吸一口冷气。 不能更熟悉了。 操。 BLUE？！ 他的脸突然被Blue带有鳞片的舌头狠狠舔了一口，这让他几乎窒息。 Owen轻轻拍了拍Blue抓着他的腰的爪子后，本以为她会立刻松开自己的爪子，然而让他不可思议的是，Blue一下把他翻了过来让他正对着她仰躺。  啊哦。仰躺，这可不是什么逃跑的好姿势。  更不可思议的事情还在后面，Blue用爪子把他蔽体的衣物全部撕裂，再用尖利的牙齿咬住，吊起扔向别处。片缕不着的Owen更是一头雾水，这是要吃了他吗，干嘛还要剥皮。他依旧不敢妄动，只能轻轻抬手试图摸上Blue的头。 “嘿好姑娘，看看我是谁，冷静，冷静。”Owen的手有些颤抖，他根本不能确定这会不会起作用，但目前他也没有更好的逃脱方法。 Blue果然停下了动作。  她歪了歪脑袋，就在Owen觉得有希望时，她突然仰头把他的手拱向一边，Owen只得全身如同十字架一般直直地躺着，以这个如同献祭的姿势表达自己并没有恶意。 然而接下来发生的事让他觉得，自己还不如就直接大胆一点，直接逃跑算了。  Blue的舌头舔上了Owen的胸口，舌头上细小的鳞片刮蹭到他的乳头，黏腻的口水粘在他身上，渐渐冷却后却给Owen带来了无尽的酥麻感。 他的乳头在冰冷的空气中马上挺立起来，而Blue对这两点似乎格外感兴趣，她舔来舔去，后来才恋恋不舍地向下游移去。  “操，这他妈的太过了……” Owen在Blue的舌头移动到他腰侧和下腹时试图挣扎，然而森林中传来的沙沙声却让他立刻警觉起来。 除了Blue，这里还有其他的恐龙！既然到目前为止，Blue还没有伤害到自己，那就没必要为自己引来更多的不可预知的危险因素。 想到这里，Owen立马停下了挣扎的动作，Blue看起来很满意于这个。 Blue的舌头还在他的腰侧游移，他刚适应这个触感，随后便被Blue整个翻了过来趴在地上。 “我操……”Owen不敢动作，他被迫跪趴在地上，臀部高高翘起，双腿被Blue的头挤着不能并拢，他的胳膊肘拄着地，刚想回头看眼他的好姑娘要做什么，马上就被后穴附近奇怪的酥麻感搞得软了身体。  Owen猛然意识到，Blue在用她的布满鳞片和突起的舌头，一下一下舔着他的屁股洞。  看见Owen有逃跑的意愿，Blue用短短的爪赶忙抓住了他紧实的臀肉，在上面留下几道血痕，锻炼得当的臀部颜色较身体其他部位的小麦色更浅一些，这几道血痕在雪白的臀肉上看起来十分色情。 疼痛和快感交织着攀上大脑，Owen已经彻底没了逃跑的机会，他最多只能用胳膊肘支撑住自己，而这几乎耗尽了他所有的力气。  Blue还在不停舔舐，Owen只能腾出一只手来抚摸自己早已硬挺的下体。她的舌头在穴口周围不停打转，时不时戳刺进去一小截，每次刺进，Owen就是一阵脱力。最后他只能放弃了爱抚自己，可Blue却突然把大半个舌头塞了进去。尽管有Blue之前分泌出的唾液润滑，但看起来尺寸十分吓人的舌头进入到他的后穴，仍让他几乎马上丢盔弃甲，Owen的老二因为疼痛迅速软了下来。   “……啊……我操……怎么这么他妈长……”Owen不知道什么时候被翻了过来，再次仰躺，大张着自己的双腿正对着Blue，他只能用一条胳膊挡住自己的视线，Blue的舌头上布满鳞片和突起，每一次抽插都会狠狠蹭上他肠壁上的腺体。  快感渐渐堆积，一下下将他推向极乐之地。 Owen正在慢慢接受自己被一头迅猛龙舔得几乎高潮这一事实。  Blue的舌头在Owen的后穴里面翻转，进行着人类难以想象的高速抽插运动，而且自从Blue发现她舔到某几个位置时，Owen就会发出一些呻吟声，她就力图每次插入都达到那几个位置。 温度较低的鳞片与火热的肠壁迅速摩擦几乎要燃烧，然而就在Owen几乎达到顶点，想要用手撸动一下自己被冷落多时的阴茎时，他的双手突然被束缚住了。 被手臂压迫多时的双眼此刻只能看到模糊的影子，好像是Delta和……Echo。这样，他完完全全将自己展现给了Blue，而她也没有辜负她的Alpha的期望，直接用舌头把她的Alpha操射了。  Owen的大腿肌肉紧绷，脚趾蜷缩起来，阴茎颤抖着吐出一股股精液，在高潮的余韵中他仅存的几分理智让他只能发出喟叹， 操，这他妈真是太扯了。 高潮后的疲倦袭来，他慢慢闭上了双眼。  Wu在厚重的玻璃外面看着里面正不停乱动后回归静止的Owen，看了看周围的屏幕上显示的Owen身体的各项指标，“诚实特性情景模拟完成。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“妈妈，你再多吃点！”  被灵超闪亮亮的眼睛盯着，岳明辉对着碗里的堆成小山的菜发愁，这再饿也吃不下这么多吧……大概是这两个月习惯了剧组的粗茶淡饭，看一桌子的粤菜都觉得油腻。  这不是阿姨做的饭菜，为了演唱会的舞台效果，他们应该马上进入减脂期，下午训练后核定体重体脂数据，就要定制食谱了。这顿可以说是“最后的晚餐”，是灵超先斩不奏，在外面的馆子点的。  岳明辉用筷子戳戳碗里的牛柳，打算找点话题来分散一下这孩子的注意力，总不能让他一直盯着自己的碗吧。  “儿子啊，你两个哥哥呢？怎么今早也没看到他们？”  “哦，木子洋一大早去面试了，好像是一个高端定制的鲜花和饰品的品牌。我早上在客厅玩手机，看到我洋哥出门，那个要杀人的表情，吓死我了……”  用聊天来转移注意力确实很科学，灵超拿着筷子一边开心的讲一边还模仿着木子洋的表情，联想到记忆里木子洋早起时的臭脸和平时穿上西装目含秋水人模狗样的笑，对比感十足，岳明辉也跟着笑了起来。  “还有我凡哥，他上次不是去旅游大使嘛，这次要去补个游记后续，估计下午就能到公司…”     提到卜凡，他明显能感到岳明辉的脸色不太好，原本想问的一句，“你们怎么了？凡哥最近怪怪的”也被他咽了下去。灵超低下头，开始专心吃饭，看着丰盛的“早餐”他确实饿了。  小孩子的记忆力有时候很好，有时候又很坏，面对鲜活的事物思维就更加灵动，愁思好像转身就可以抛弃。灵超刚扒了会儿饭，就像是想起什么一样，又盯起岳明辉的碗，红着脸小声儿道。  “岳妈妈，你多吃点，我怕……怕你抱不动我……”  “……”  小弟垂着头，一副乖巧的模样，看得岳明辉内心一动，伸手揉了揉他的头发。  “哎呀，小孩别瞎操心，放心交给你岳妈妈吧！”     因为上午练习室只有两个人，舞蹈老师就直接带他们扒双人舞台。岳明辉坐在凳子上，灵超抱着iPad坐在了他的大腿上，一起认真的看着舞蹈视频。这次的双人舞台融入了一些现代芭蕾的元素，中间确实有一些托举和翻转，需要两人的配合。芭蕾虽然看起来柔美，其实是蕴含着力量，对肌肉和爆发力的要求也很高。  灵超对舞蹈兴致盎然，之前核定舞蹈时也参考了很多他的建议，对于融入自己心血的作品，小孩表现出跃跃欲试。看到灵超认真的样子，岳明辉会心一笑，难得小弟这么喜欢，自己这次也要拼一把了。  “嘶…”  岳明辉刚起身，大腿就传来一阵痛感。之前拍一个翻过矮墙迅速隐蔽的戏份时拉上了大腿，反正不是严重的问题，为了拍摄进度就一直选择性忽略。这几天休息不好，加上昨晚被凡子“撞”了一下，岳明辉不禁叹气，和凡子较劲，自己又哪一次赢过……  “岳妈妈？怎么了？”     灵超回头看向他，工作状态的灵超是非常认真的，丝毫没有平日的“皮实”，他表情紧绷，眼里发散着炽热渴求的目光。岳明辉不忍心扰了他的兴致，站起身活动活动筋骨，开始加入灵超一起做准备运动。     只练了一上午，岳明辉整个人就像在在水里淋了一遍，衣服都变得湿答答的。他走进更衣间，顺手掩上了门。自从小有名气之后，赶通告的时间越来越多，真正大块的训练时间越来越少，今年这次集训他确实感受到了力不从心。  说到这个小房间原本是杂物间，后来随着来公司办业务的人员越来越繁杂，为了避免偷拍之类不必要的麻烦，公司干脆把这个没有窗的杂物间改造成了更衣室。  他把刚换下来的湿衣服扔进了更衣间的洗衣机里，便被墙上的贴着的海报所吸引。在拮据的更衣柜中间的墙上，贴着一张凡子的海报，是这次做旅游大使拍的，应该是还未披露的海报，不知道被谁挂在了这里。  照片里凡子站在山城的砖路上，身后是成片成片的白色建筑和湛蓝的爱琴海，晶亮的日光落在他身上，看起来整个人都发着光。他咧开嘴角，笑得温柔甜蜜，配上他硬朗的脸，充满了蓬勃的活力。让他不由得想起他们年轻时，一起拍硬照，凡子准备时还在叨叨着rap抱怨，结果一开机笑得比谁都甜……想到这儿，岳明辉不禁弯起了嘴角。  他面对着海报发呆，昨天晚上他也没见到凡子。他们是分批回的宿舍，等他进屋时整栋楼都静悄悄的。他不由得心里有点发苦，如果一个人想躲你，即使是方寸之地也难照面。     卜凡进来看到的就是这幅场景，岳明辉呆呆的站在他的海报前，不知道在想着什么，连自己进来都没注意到。他懵懂的样子让卜凡内心一动。  他是恨岳明辉的，也更恨自己，恨自己的情绪总被他牵绊。卜凡得出了一个结论，岳明辉这个人有毒。一切的开始，他只是为了羞辱这个功利熏心的人，却在看到岳明辉在隐忍中流露的媚态，难以把持的搞到了床上。但害人终害己，没成想竟然是自己先食髓知味，反而越陷越深，把这种要命的关系维系到了今天。  其实经过长期的契合，他本以为岳明辉正在慢慢改变，但现实很快把他打醒。他并不是在意一个角色，而是又一次对眼前的人的失望。疏远冷漠是他在岳明辉不在时作出的一个决定，但当再见到他时，原本垒好的防线再次崩塌。  他昨天先一步离开会议室，便去找老师要到了舞蹈视频，一边看一边和舞蹈老师对动作的可操作性聊到了很晚。视频里的芭蕾舞步轻盈，看起来有种脆弱的美感，同时又充满了力量，他竟开始觉得这段舞是适合岳明辉的……     于是在看到岳明辉盯着自己的海报露出温暖的笑意时，他的内心再一次被拉扯。他深深的感到他是恨岳明辉，恨他的绝情又温柔。  卜凡无法压抑来自内心的难过，岳明辉，因为你我才这么痛苦，你也别想好过。     他径直走过去，手顺着岳明辉宽松的运动裤探鲁进去，不由分说的抓上他的命根子。身前的人的一声惊喘，很快便安静下来，手扶上旁边的柜子，任由他粗鲁的揉捏。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*“Maybe I can try again?” Eugene asked.   Rapunzel nodded. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*His finger fit, so why shouldn’t his cock fit?  “Maybe I can try again?” Eugene asked.   Rapunzel nodded.  He pressed himself against her, his tip feeling her entrance and tried to push forward. She grimaced and gave a grunt. His cock did not want to go in.   “Nope,” he said.  He sat up and looked at his cock and then looked at her entrance. He was fairly big and she was small, but  come on!  Babies came out that way! His cock was smaller than a baby, so why did it not fit?  He grabbed his hair.   She sat up next to him, wrapped an arm around him.   “It’s okay, Eugene. We’ll figure it out,” Rapunzel said. “Trial and error.”  She kissed his cheek, and then turned his face to look at her and kissed him on his lips, her hands on his face...   He found himself lying underneath blankets next to her, wrapped in an embrace with her, giggling with her, as they touched each other and cuddled, and his cock making contact with her genitals but nothing more. But it was pleasurable. And, for now, this would work. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Summer Drabble Prompt #111: Shaved Ice  The A/C is broken and they've run out of ways to keep cool. Louis thinks outside the box in order to keep Harry comfortable and satisfied. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Harry is blindfolded on the bed on all fours as Louis gingerly pours the remnants of cherry flavoured shaved ice onto Harry's arched back, licking and sucking the water as it pools, then watches it cascade down his rim and drip off his balls.  Louis rearranges himself so he's underneath a mewling and overwhelmed Harry. He laps at the liquid trickling down his balls, he takes turns sucking each one in his mouth for what feels like an eternity to Harry. Louis decides it's time, grips Harry's cock and pumps roughly until Harry's moaning and coming hard into his hand. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*会议一直在有条不紊地进行，岳明辉努力的通过会议内容来分散注意力，幻想着凡子闹够了玩累了就会收手，但桌子下的脚却没有要放过他的意思，一直在时轻时重的捻着他的下体。  柱身和前端在脚掌的玩弄下欢快的弹动，连后面的两颗小球也被细心的照顾。渗出的前液湿答答的粘在内裤上，随着下体的涨大，棉质的内裤突起了饱满的形状。几下大力的捻动下，下体又颤抖地涌出了几鼓液体。  岳明辉感觉自己像飘在云端的风筝，被欲望折磨的不断起伏。他额上渗着汗，眨着眼煽动着潮湿的睫毛，埋起头偷偷咬着舌尖，极力的忍耐着一波又一波的快感。羞耻感让身体格外敏感，下体胀得难受，轻缓的挑逗却总能在他快到达顶点时停下，又在他觉得热度开始消退时缠上来。他的身体，卜凡太了解了……  “老师，我有个建议。”  恍然之际，却是对面的凡子开了口。下体的脚掌不知何时已经撤去，凡子一手拿着笔，端正的挺起上身缓缓开口。  “我们之前的双人合作舞台，一直都是我和老岳的搭配，不能让粉丝眼前一亮啊，我觉得这次可以换换。我和洋子的身高差不多，搭配演出应该会效果不错。而且，咱俩这个条件还可以搞一个“力量”为主题的双人舞……”  卜凡的发言引来三双目光的关注，只有岳明辉低头攥着笔一言不发。木子洋疑惑的看向卜凡，见他坚定的目光不太像玩笑，随后也了然一笑。  “老师，我没意见，都听安排。”  灵超有点儿担忧的看向岳明辉欲言又止。空气中短暂的安静，所有人都陷入了思考。  “嗯……这个提议倒也不是不可以，挺有新意。但是，嗯，这个计划我之前只跟灵超私下商讨过。就是灵超这组要在舞蹈中加入一段组合杂技……嗯，就是有一点难度，所以我得先征求一下岳岳的意见，你觉得可以接受吗？”  气氛又陷入了沉默，当人们觉得某件事儿约定俗成，甚至成为习惯时，去做出改变就会是一件很尴尬的事。  岳明辉抬起头，木子洋才得以看清他的表情。他神色如常，脸颊泛起微微的红晕，一只手搭在桌边，胸口抵在桌边的手上，双腿不自然的蜷缩在桌下。     “老师，我可……”  “具体是什么类型的动作呢？”  带着些嘶哑的嗓音刚开口，便被卜凡浑厚的声音抢断。岳明辉惊讶的看向他，卜凡没有理会岳明辉抛过来的目光，认真的看向舞蹈导演。  “难度有多大？我在考虑舞台完成性的问题，不能因为我这个突然的提议影响整体效果，那我这个就是画蛇添足了。”  岳明辉原本眼中泛起的点点亮光随即淡了下去，凡子说得都对，甚至可以说得上是革新意义的提议，但他却还是感到失落难过。之前，不论卜凡和自己生多大的气，只会在工作之后的时间找自己发泄……他从来没公开划清过与自己界限，面对这次的拒绝，他有预感，这次他和凡子是真的要走到尽头了。  “哦，这个嘛，其实岳岳主要需要提供力量支撑，主体难度的动作还是由灵超来完成，主要是需要一定的体力和配合度。”     岳明辉抵住有点发痛的胸口，把这种疼痛划归为失去原本责任支持后的一种倦怠，他内心有点发苦，为什么人在乎的东西都要离自己远去？但眼前的几双眼睛都在等着自己的答复，岳明辉收起 自己的情绪，不自觉的开始扣手，内心安慰自己道，日子不还得继续嘛，只不过是拆搭档，又不是再也不见。  “行，老师，我觉得我没什么问题。”  “但是，岳叔……”  “哎呀，没事儿，妈妈还少抱你了嘛？”     会议持续到很晚，散会时大家都纷纷起身舒展筋骨，岳明辉动了动酸麻的腰腿，会议的后半程开始，交流变得很多，他为了掩饰尴尬，只能夹紧腿，幸好之后卜凡再也没对他做什么。如果不是股间冰凉湿粘的触感，他甚至觉得之前只是长期禁欲后的一场春梦。  他一直等到会议室没人时，才勉强起身，其实下体的挺立早已经消退，他扶着桌子，腿上传来的酸麻让他跌回凳子里。他叹了口气，靠在椅子里，等针刺一般的麻痹感过去才敢起身。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*当李涛蹲在他对面时，岳明辉已经挣扎着靠墙坐了起来，他可以肯定如果被眼前这个一米九的人提着领子拎起来，应该不会是什么好的体验。他曲左腿，手臂虚搭在膝盖上，做出他自认为很潇洒的姿态，其实刚恢复意识本人并不能看清面前的李涛是人是狗。至少现在的姿势他很满意，即可以挡住胸口的要害，又看起来很从容。他并没意识到自己衣衫半敞的样子实际上是透着魅惑的。     李涛盯着他胸口裸露的皮肤，自然没有玩物丧志的意思，反而轻笑出来。     “卜凡这小子出息了，能找到你这样一个顶雷的，呵，不过我对男人可不感兴趣。”  岳明辉对他的话还能听清个大概，卜凡两个字让他涣散的神经开始聚拢，之前组织过的言辞脱口而出。  “李涛，不管你们之前发生过什么，那些都已经过去了。在这个圈子里谁不为了混口饭吃，何必呢？”  “不可能！他欠我的我永远都忘不了！我告诉你，之前那些算是给你的见面礼，你最好乖乖回家，把他换过来，不然……嘿嘿。我再提醒你一下，你跟他只是队友，看看你现在狼狈的样子，岳明辉，不值得的。”     说着李涛的手不自觉的伸向他的胸口，他以为岳明辉会打开他的手，但粗糙的大手却毫无阻碍的掐上了光裸的胸口。李涛也是一愣，他对男人可是真没什么兴趣，接触到光滑的肌肤马上触电般的收回了手。那人的胸口骨感分明，只覆着薄薄的一层肌肉，和女人柔软的触感完全不同，这种感觉有点奇妙。他偷偷捻动着两指，竟觉得指尖粘着些滑腻的触感。     对此岳明辉却毫无反应，满脑子都是如何劝他放弃幼稚的报复。只要是活人，任何问题都是可以谈妥的，他要的不止是着一次的保全，他要的是更长久的东西。     “李涛，你走到今天这步也不容易吧，别因为点旧事毁了今日的成就，那可太不值得了。凡子……凡子之前不管怎么对不起你，我这个做队长的就代他说声抱歉，你有什么问题可以直接找我……”  李涛被他的话震惊住了，这样的说辞简直闻所未闻。在他眼里，旁人如果有一丁点儿问题，都想马上撇清和自己的关系，而这个疯子却把事情往自己身上揽！他越发的烦躁，大概是称之为嫉妒的情绪，他嫉妒卜凡那样的人竟会有人为他做到这般，而自己却孤独飘零，用尽手段却处处受阻！当初，当初如果不是卜凡，这个位子绝对应该是他的！他只能咬牙切齿的道。  “岳明辉，知道我今天为什么能最快出现吗？我就是为了来看你狼狈的样子，怎么？没受够？那我就先废了你，再废了卜凡！”     放狠话的人粗鲁的抓起岳明辉的领口，本身尚未清醒的人被提着领子摇晃，眼前金星四溅。张张口想说什么，却组织不起语言。     所幸那人放完狠话就转身离开了。看着那人消失在门口的身影，岳明辉慢慢滑落下去。他看向手边泥洼里的水，不自觉的咽了口吐沫，还是决定先休息一下再回去，不然小林又要担心了。     他回到休息区，小林果然还是哭丧着脸，咱们这是得罪谁了，哥哥每天都被耗得一身伤，人都瘦了一圈！就好像有人针对他们一样！     看到岳明辉惨败的脸色，汗湿的头发，深深的自责涌了上来。小林平日自觉的本人很讨喜社交能力也不错，以往剧组里上到老妹下到小哥都很快能混得不错，就连在一线剧组演个男十八号时，岳哥也没遭这么多罪！只怪这次自己怎么就没打点好。  小林自然对刚刚发生的一切一无所知，他赶忙迎上去扶着岳明辉坐下，岳哥的身体不比年轻人，尤其是跟着这种朝令夕改的剧组折腾，他真怕戏没拍完他岳哥先被折腾垮了。看着岳明辉闭目养神，满眼都是心疼，一会得出去弄点营养的给岳哥补补，他岳哥最近确实状态不好。     之后几天，岳明辉意外的迎来了短暂的平静，没有恶意拖延的戏份也没有拍摄困难的镜头。偶尔有近身的打戏，总体来说也非常顺利。     这天岳明辉正在和负责自己的导演助理对戏，对着对着便聊了起来。     “诶，我看你小子人不错，怎么就被卖进了这个剧组？好好的偶像不当，你来非洲找罪受？”  “赵导这是哪的话，你不也来了嘛，都是看好这剧的市场。”     “嘿，你小子还真挺虚伪。”  “来都来了，总不能回去吧，跌份儿，我也是要面子的嘛哈哈哈哈”  赵导蹲在临时搭建的棚子阴影里吸着烟，一口一个圈儿，他意味深长的看着岳明辉“诶，我看你小子来这儿也没少遭罪，都不后悔？这个操蛋的社会啊，就是你自己不喊痛，就没人会主动关怀你，想生存就得学会哭学会说委屈，不然不知道在什么无人的角落里就垮了……”     岳明辉靠在墙边，笑着反问道，“那赵导您是靠着诉说委屈走到今天的层度吗？”  “……”     “我知道，当然不是。是天赋或者能力吧？当然还有一定要把一件事儿做好的责任感……因为有些原则是无论何时都无法放弃的。”     “嘿呦，现在的年轻人，讲道理还一套一套的，以后吃亏了可别怪我没提醒你。”     “哈哈，行，那我在这儿就先谢谢您了。”     突然草丛里一个鬼鬼祟祟的身影向山丘方向移动，从背影来看，是李涛无疑。岳明辉有些不放心，开口道，“赵导，山那边是什么地方？一会儿有戏吗？”     “哦，那边啊，是新设的爆破点，一会应该有爆破试验，为了之后机场戏做背景用的……诶？你去哪啊？那边危险。”     还没等赵导说完，岳明辉便抬腿跑了出去，虽然不知道即将发生什么，但他有预感，绝对不是什么好事情。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*岳明辉再次醒来天已经黑了，房间里没有人，后穴和手腕上都传来一阵清凉，显然已经被细心照料过了。他睁着眼竖着耳朵听着房子里的动静，确定没人在家，便打算移动回自己的房间。  双腿刚着地，却像踩在棉花上，腰腿的酸软差点让他直接跪下去。这次也不是有多痛，更多的是力不从心的疲惫。岳明辉呆呆的看着手腕上变成深紫色的淤痕，看来自己真要休息几天了……     借着接了个“大活”为借口，其他不必要的活动都被公司暂停了。岳明辉躲在自己房间闭门不出，小林怕他自己生活不能自理，每天按时订外卖供着。毕竟也是国内小有名气的组合，每位成员的个人工作都很多，没有团体活动队友们也时常不见踪影。只有小弟，每天只要回家早，就一如既往的往他怀里钻，连玩游戏都要靠着他的肩膀。就这样安静的日子就如流水一般，直到他捏着护照拎着行李箱站在门口，才惊觉，他有几天没见到凡子了？     其实他现在还不敢见凡子，他怕看到出现在他脸上的任何异样的表情，但内心还是隐隐的失落，又不是第一次长时间分开工作，但就是出门前想看上一眼，哪怕是背影也让人觉得安心。     但生活并没有什么戏剧化，直到他走的前一天也没再见到卜凡，一纸薄薄的机票就把二人送往了非洲。同行的小林还是有点紧张的，飞机上一直翻看剧组的拍摄日程。  “岳哥，我看了计划，咱们大概要在非洲呆上一个月！你这回去又要黑了，不过幸好，我给你带了一箱面膜，咱们每天下戏就贴！”  “成成成，都听你的。”  岳明辉闭目养神，他们是最后一批整合完毕飞往非洲的，半个飞机都是剧组的工作人员。小林实在坐不住，跑去各个位置晃荡，一方面也是为了在剧组混个脸熟，也能帮岳哥和自己争取点福利。  “天呐！你真的是那个oner的岳岳？”  岳明辉睁开眼，看到身边不知道什么时候坐过来的女孩，干净的短发语气灵动，看起来非常元气。不知道对方是谁，岳明辉依旧礼貌的笑笑。  “哦哦，忘了介绍了，我是道具组的小岩，之前就听说会有oner的队员出演，我一开始还不相信呢！啊，我的闺蜜特别喜欢你，我能不能拍张照片给她！”     被热女孩的热情感染，给枯燥的旅途增加了些色彩，他礼貌的坐直了身体，笑道，“谢谢你们对oner的喜爱，不过，不好意思，公司不允许合影，但我可以签个名送你，嗯，你带笔了吗？”     “啊嗷嗷，我去取！”  女孩慌慌张张的站起身，却因为不太宽敞的空间站立不稳，险些摔倒，幸好岳明辉手快，在她腰上托了一下，才幸免女孩没有直接摔在他身旁。  “嗯，要小心。”  “啊！谢谢！真的太感谢了！”  …………     飞机上，拿着签名卡的女孩哼着歌转到了卫生间，她拿出刚刚的签名卡，随便折了几下便丢进废纸篓里，按了冲水离开了。     拍摄这种重武器重道具的戏，真的和打仗一个样，卡车上拉着战车，各种道具组灯光组后勤组导演组拿着对讲机忙成一团……人们即使带着墨镜和面巾也眯缝着眼，干热的沙土地表，接受太阳的直射，午间能达到55度！     场景准备还没到位，岳明辉抱着狙击枪躺矮房楼顶，接受太阳的炙烤，只有胸口往上勉强能缩在阴影里。要说命运着东西很奇妙，多年前他连躺在酒店的阳台晒太阳经纪人都不被不允许，现在却可以尽情的躺在太阳下。看着日影移动已经快到正午，自己大概就在这躺了快2个小时吧……  强烈的日照下，汗水根本留不住。他干脆翻了身，想要面向太阳，在太阳离地球几乎最近的位置感受日光的能量也是个不错的体验。  “唔”  随着动作，尖锐的痛感从脚踝传过来。他勉强翻身，躺在地上喘气。李涛这孙子还真没吓唬他，自从他进组以来待遇确实不能算好。不仅换场次了经常没人通知，让他白白等一整天，或是道具的鞋子是残次品，码数不对磨出许些水泡，鞋子里的钢板又有些错位，硌得他脚踝也红肿了起来。又或者是今天，上工时间延后也并没有人通知他，现在他躺在天台上开始怀疑今天到底有没有这拍摄。  看着太阳越来越亮，他却觉得头脑发热，视线也不太清晰。他舔了舔干裂的嘴唇，能感到咸涩的汗水顺着鼻梁淌下来。岳明辉开始意识到，糟了，自己中暑了……  小二楼四下无人，喊人过来肯定是不可行的。他的手摸向身上的口袋，想打给小林帮忙，却发现自己上戏并没带手机。上学时学到的自救措施浮现在脑海，他用尽全力抬起手，慢慢的去结自己的领口。防弹甲和各种装备套得很厚，像粗砺的藤蔓把他牢牢裹住，他反复尝试，颤抖的手指根本勾不稳扣子。心脏也在鼓鼓的跳动，震得他脑子突突跳个不停，原本晶亮的日光，在眼前变成了万花筒，缤纷的色彩飞快的旋转，叫人想要干呕。     直到岳明辉觉得他蹉跎的人世游历就要画上句号时，却被兜头而来的清凉唤回神志。大股清凉的水直接浇在自己脸上，他不顾流进眼睛鼻子的水，张口想要让这股清凉滋润一下快要冒火的喉咙，却引起一阵呛咳，不断拉扯着他吞了像砂纸一样的声带。  他尽力平复着呼吸，眼前才慢慢清明起来，此处光线很暗，应该是个室内，他狼狈的躺在僵硬的地上，沙土的腥味充斥着鼻腔，他判断这应该就是刚刚那栋土楼的室内。他的辎重被扒下来仍在一旁，单薄的迷彩服扣子被解开大半，露出的胸口同样也是濡湿一片。     他想要起身，眼前却出现了一双黑色的高帮的战靴，一脚踢开了滚在他身边的两个空了的矿泉水瓶子，冰冷轻蔑的语气从头顶传来。     “怎么，oner的队长这么弱不禁风？这种程度就受不住了，我还没开始好好玩呢～”     岳明辉闭了闭眼，艹，是李涛那孙子…… *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Soul thinks he's going to tap into an old fantasy of Maka's. It doesn't quite go as planned, but he's not complaining. (Approximately drabble-length, includes drawing.) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Down her spine and up his chest run two thrills, a connected resonance. On a whim, he whispers, teeth grazing her throat.  “Come for me, please…Angel.”  A smile breaks across her face, the unexpected levity tickling at her until she can’t hold back. She strengthens her embrace to keep him close and lets the laughter come, tightening around him, each gale of mirth racking its way through her to culminate on his dick.  It’s not what he expected, but it’s…damn, it’s pretty good. “Oh, fuck,” Soul says, sheepish and giddy at the pleasure he’s found in the stirring of amusement deep inside his partner.  Maka recovers just enough to kiss his silly grin.            *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*赵启平醒过来的时候，只听到耳边有“嘟”的一声，然后是开门的声音。然后他就闻到了一股若有若无的清雅香气，小赵医生想到自家男人的种种“前科”，忍不住噌地一下从凌远怀中支棱起来，颤抖着声音问：“老凌！你……你开这房花了多少钱！”  凌院长无奈地摇头笑笑，抱紧了自家的小财迷，一路往里面走。传说中占了顶楼整层的总统套房果然名不虚传，凌远想，他的胳膊都快要断了，怎么还没走到卧室？  赵启平在躺上那张云朵一样柔软的大床的时候，就知道自家的败家爷们儿为了这一宿至少造了几千刀出去。想到这儿小赵医生不禁叹了口气，磨了磨牙道：“咱俩要是不干足一宿，都对不起这个房钱……”  凌院长难得地笑出声来，扶着自己的老腰嘎吱嘎吱地左右转了转。小赵医生故意打了个呵欠，慵懒的声音努力掩饰着自己的急切：“到底怎么着呀？再过一会儿，我可就要睡着啦。”  凌远不急着回答他，而是慢慢踱了两步，从容不迫地伸手解开了西服扣子，把外套脱了下来。静谧的房间中，衣料摩擦的声音显得神秘又暧昧，小医生有点急，小幅度地在床上扭蹭了几下，有些委屈地喊着爱人的名字：“凌远！”  “我在呢，宝贝儿。”凌远松开衬衫的两颗扣子，扯松了领带，弯下腰安抚般地吻他的额头：“我今天……准备了些特殊的节目，可以吗？”  赵启平有些紧张地吞咽了一下，张了张嘴，最终轻声说了一句：“我是你的。”     微凉的手指轻轻抚在脸上，一路向下，滑过下巴和咽喉，轻车熟路地解开所有的衬衫扣子，皮带，裤链，剥下黑色的棉袜。如此普通的事情被凌远当成一场重大的仪式，紧张和羞涩无限地放大了赵启平的感官，令每一丝肌肤上的震颤都像一场风暴一样，撩拨起他汹涌的情欲。凌远看到那他腿间布料那熟悉的形状，忍不住自语般赞叹了一句：“今天……好快呀。”  小医生的呼吸已经急促起来，他无声地挺着腰，想要凌远更多，更多的触碰。凌远却从容得过分，拧了几条热毛巾，把他从发际到脚趾，每一寸肌肤每一丝褶皱都仔仔细细地擦了一遍。温热粗糙的布料擦去了皮肤上的角质，小赵医生白皙的皮肤下开始透出隐隐的绯色来，在微凉的空气中无声地渴求着爱人的抚摸。凌远给他擦完身，扶着他坐了起来，递给他一杯插着吸管的温水，低声道：“喝了它。一会儿你会出很多水。”  赵启平被他的话臊得呻吟了一声，却还是顺从地含住吸管，一口一口地把水喝光。凌远接过杯子，在他额头上奖励般地落下一个轻吻：“乖孩子。”  凌院长放下杯子，然后拉起赵启平的手，把一个东西放在他手心下。小赵医生轻轻地摸了摸，有些疑惑地问：“这是……保鲜膜？”  “对。”凌远把保鲜膜筒从他手中拿过来，撕开一小块，覆在他的手上：“我想，等一下用这个把你的身体包起来，可以吗？“  “……Mummification？”小赵医生博览群黄网，自然知道这种玩法，忍不住瑟缩着靠近了凌远的身体。凌远用温暖干燥的手掌轻轻摩挲着他的脸颊，蛊惑般在他耳边轻轻道：“放松点，不要怕，我是你的爱人，你的医生……我不会伤到你的。相信我。”  “可，可是我……”赵启平反复舔着他潮湿的嘴唇，声音中不由自主地带上了哭腔：“我……我能不能看着你？我有点……我一点心理准备都没有……”  “别怕，别怕。”凌远坐在他身旁，温柔地把他揽进自己怀里，用自己的唇去摩挲他的额头：“你还能摸到我的身体，能闻到我的味道，对不对？而且我相信，就算我把你包裹起来，剥夺了你所有的感官，你也同样能感受到我……那应该是种很玄妙的感觉吧，真的不想试试吗？”  赵启平在黑暗中无声地颤抖起来，他十指收紧，紧紧地抓着身下的床单，努力抑制着自己回抱住爱人的冲动。凌院长看他这样子，又心疼又紧张地咬紧了自己的嘴唇，小心翼翼地盯着他的每一丝反应。小赵医生沉默了半晌，终于深吸了一口气，小声道：“那你……呼吸声放重一点嘛。”  凌远笑了出来，用额头蹭蹭他的鬓角，柔声应了声“好”。赵启平坐起身子，两只手都小猫爪子似的紧张地蜷缩着，问：“我……我该怎么做。”  “深呼吸。”凌远起身，轻轻拿起他的左手，把他的手放在自己的手心，像小时候收集糖纸那样，近乎虔诚地把那只纤瘦凌厉的美手一点点放松、展平。赵启平深深地吸气，努力平复着自己已经超速的心跳，彻底放弃了对这具躯壳的一切控制权，把自己交到了凌远手里。凌院长有意放重了呼气的力道，温暖带潮的鼻息拂过小医生手臂上的汗毛，引得赵启平一阵轻微的颤栗。这样的反应让凌远惊喜不已，他轻笑了一下，郑重地握好爱人的手指，把第一块保鲜膜覆上了他的指尖。     ======高铁今晚到站====== *~*TEXT*~*

Hizashi’s big, bright yellow cocks were stuffed into his ass and cunt, pushing so deep inside him you could see the outline of the one in his cunt pressing out against his abdomen. He couldn’t speak, the only sounds were the water around him and Shouta’s loud moans and bitten-off screams as the huge eel merman pounded into him. As Hizashi’s lengths continued to rub against him, he felt himself tightening around them, and Hizashi growled, claws digging into his ribs.  “Now you know that you’d never be able to run away from me little fishy, not that you’d want to~” Hizashi’s sweet, melodic voice pushed him over the edge, and he screamed, clutching the merman’s back as he ground down on the cocks inside of him, gasping out Hizashi’s name. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*  008. Plan * Damian's forehead digs into the mattress-edge, his feet rock with his body thrusting against the inside of his palm moistening with warm pre-come. His heart beats quickly in his ribcage. Door unlocked. Bad move. Don't care at this point. Let him be found. Let  Grayson  find him. Let him  punish  Damian for it. With a softer, hungrier noise, he mashes his nose into the Nomex material draping over his free hand, breathing deep into Grayson's musk, too familiar, too raw — too,  too  close.  Close . Damian pants raggedly, open-mouthed against the crotch of the Nightwing suit, imagining  sucking  the heat right from Grayson's length. His cock twitches with the ongoing pleasure, and the bedroom door starts to jiggle, alerting him. Damian's eyes shoot open. Come on. His feet ache. *   *~*TEXT*~*

From where she is, there's no overhead lighting. Everybody inside the regulation sleeping quarters are missing due to eating hours. She skips them for an opportunity of  privacy . There's slits of yellowed, bright sunlight hitting the tops of Kylo's naked, mole-dusted shoulders. He looks at her with a slow, purposeful and well-disguised fascination.  Rey's knees draw up towards her body, separating further open when Kylo's fingers  flex .  He's  inside  her — she can feel it. Somehow.  What sounds like a squeaking, high-pitched noise escapes her, as Rey quivers all over, letting him to invade and overwhelm her senses, arching in. Her own fingers, already in the confines of her custom-uniform pajamas, stroke faster to her clit.  Kylo seems like he's in  deeper , burrowing out a place to stay, and Rey throws her head back, burning-hot from the sudden, throbbing orgasm.  As it abandons her, she's left gasping alone in darkness, cooling down and slickening her thighs.  *    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~* Sonic was running around, doing random shit one day. Everything seemed normal… Until…  “ I want to fuck you in the ass Sonic! ” Eggman said, while running at Sonic.  “ Oh no! Eggman wants to fuck me in the ass! I gotta run! ”  Sonic started to run even faster than he was 5 seconds ago. He tried to out run Eggman, but Eggman was ever faster than Sonic. Eventually, Eggman was able to catch up to Sonic, and tackled Sonic to the ground.  “ Ha! Now I will rape you with my Egg cock! ”   Eggman then proceeded to rape Sonic in the ass. Sonic could do nothing to stop Eggman.   Eggman fucked Sonic for about 5.67432696969420 seconds. After Eggman was done fucking Sonic, Eggman left.   And then Sonic died from Aids, but that was unrelated.   The end *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Merula looked so beautiful on my bed. The once mean and spicy Slytherin was now gasping and wincing at the feeling of love. She was almost like a different person.  "Merula! I'm gonna... I'm gonna..." Suddenly, my libido stopped.  "The hell!?" Merula shouted.  "If you wanna blow your load in her, you gotta blow your load on us!" The businessman returned. Merula shoved me off her body then fingered herself.  "How about  I  blow  my  load on  you !?" She shouted as she gave out a yell. Her cum sprayed all over the businessman.  "Gross!" The businessman went away. I jizzed. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The fire that killed Mary Winchester changed their lives forever. Unable to handle raising his young sons, John tells Dean that Sammy died and gives the baby to family. Dean is raised by Pastor John and enters the priesthood. When Sam acts out so badly he runs out of family he is left to the care of Father Winchester and Pastor Jim at their reform school. There’s an undeniable spark between Sam and Dean…and then they discover they are brothers. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*    Priest!Dean on his knees, worshipping the only way he knows how.   I'm not a particularly brilliant NC-17 sketch artist, so this picture is based on a favourite photo of mine, obviously I've drawn it with my own little tweaks in, to show Priest!Dean and Young Rebel!Sam as I see them in this fantastic story.   I know that ddbb has placed these pieces of art throughout the story and we're both intrigued to see if they've gone where I 'pictured' them :D Anyway, she'll be unlocking her post after her night shift, which ends in about four hours I think. When she does, please go and check it out, it's one of the hottest, sweetest, most amazingly written pieces I've ever had the pleasure to play with :D  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Spock walked through the dark halls of the ship, his boots quickly clicking against the floor as he visualized the harp solo he’d wind down with as soon he collapsed into bed. He was almost to his quarters, the door numbers leading up to his getting smaller and smaller in the lonely solitude of Deck 12.  But one door was conspicuously open. Spock peeked into the room, wondering who would be so careless as to leave their room ajar.  Panting loudly, lying on his back, legs splayed open in a wide V, was a sweaty Leonard McCoy, masturbating furiously, his fist clenched hard onto his penis as he jerked his tight grip back and forth with ferocious grunts. Noticing the figure at his doorway, he paused, hand on cock, and looked over at Spock.  “Come on in and help your ol’ doctor out, you green-blooded peeping Tom,” teased McCoy with a wink.  Spock shut the door from the inside. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*One afternoon in Giuliano's bedroom, a stolen moment of mutual pleasure between him and Vanessa. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Giuliano moaned as Vanessa stroked his cock. She gave a soft laugh of delight and nuzzled at his ear. He fondled her breasts, wanting to give as well as receive pleasure. He was breathless, soaked in sweat already, his heart was racing. This was glorious. Then with her free hand, Vanessa took one of his and guided it between her legs. She slowed her motions until he found his own rhythm, his fingers stroking her genitals and arousing her in turn. Their movements quickened, each in synchronisation with the other, panting and keeping eye contact, urging each other on without words. Giuliano held off as long as he could, but came first. Vanessa leaned to press a quick kiss to his hair in reassurance and after a few moments he brought her to orgasm. They lay alongside each other on his silk sheets, exhausted but content, and Giuliano thought they were glowing from the shared pleasure, luminous in the late afternoon sunshine. *~*TEXT*~*

This is the fifth time this afternoon that the two of you had fallen into bed and yet you still haven’t knotted. Thankful that he isn’t in a rut of his own, Gabriel urges you on with every thrust, the fingers of one hand teasing around your clit, “Come on, sugar. I know you want to. You’ll feel so much better if you let go.”  “Just a little more,” you pant with a voice strained from screaming out your pleasure earlier as your fingers curl tight into the sheets. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*You groan as you grind down against Gabriel, driving him deeper into your depths. From the resulting cries of pleasure the Archangel makes, you half expect the Winchesters to be breaking down the door and demanding answers at any minute. Reaching out, you grab ahold of your discarded panties and ball them up before stuffing them in Gabriel’s mouth. The simple action shocks him into silence as he works his jaw to try and dislodge the silken gag. You could swear that you feel his cock grow harder inside you as he thrusts up harshly, obviously liking it.  “If you don’t want an audience you either have to be quiet or keep that mouth stuffed full,” You say, leaning forward and gripping his wrists, holding him in place.  The corner of Gabriel’s mouth tips up into a hint of a smile right before your pussy clamps down around him. He lets loose a moan that still escapes around his makeshift gag and clenched teeth. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Neal’s quite happy to take it from  his  the top, Auror Potter. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“All right, Mr Caffrey,” Harry said, “why don’t we take it from the top.” “I love taking it from the top,” Neal tossed back, his face alight with amusement. “And feds are so much more boring than Aurors when it comes to interesting positions.” “Like the position you took with the FBI, despite knowing it was a breach of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy?” Neal’s response was witty, charming, credible, and utter bollocks. He wasn’t going to cooperate as long as he felt in control: as long as he could con them. Harry Summoned a ballgag. “Hey, what – ”   ~*~ “Open wide.” After a long, tense moment of those intense blue eyes trained on the gag, Neal opened his mouth: he wasn’t a fighter. “Nothing that comes out of your mouth is going to be helpful right now.” Harry slipped the ball into Neal’s mouth, stretching those lush lips, and strapped on the gag. Neal looked up at him appealingly with those big blue eyes. Harry smiled. Harry fucked him thoroughly, leaving bruises on hips and shoulders, feeling the tight heat of Neal’s arse and smelling his musk. Neal’s whimpering cries never let up, and he half-screamed when he came. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Cormac and Romilda enjoy each other in a variety of ways. A tiny, short drabble. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*They took it in turns.  Sometimes, it was Romilda, cuffed to the bed posts, her limbs spread, as Cormac teased her gently. His fingers, his mouth, his tongue, all soft and warm, pressed against every inch of her body one after the other, arousing her in ways she’d never thought possible. Her breath would escape in stutters as he lowered himself to her, and she’d push her hips upwards, longing desperately for his touch.  Sometimes, it was Cormac, hands tied above his head with silk handkerchiefs and one wrapped carefully around his eyes. He’d shudder as Romilda experimentally ran the feather of her quill down the centre of his chest, the inside of his thighs, the backs of his arms, until he was leaking and begging. His strangled gasps when she finally gave him what he wanted were always worth the wait.  Sometimes, it was neither of them. Free, they’d grasp at each other’s bodies, arching against each other, eyes falling closed, mouths falling open, the cries of each other’s names on their lips and hanging in the air like a subtle promise.  They took it in turns, exploring each other, learning new things each time, always hungering for more. *~*TEXT*~*

By your side, wearing a goddamn smirk, Dean was wearing his best poker face while playing with your clit with his fingers.  “Dean,” you moaned softly, stroking his cock in your hand.  “Shh,” he moved to your side, kissing the side of your face. “You don’t want anyone to catch us, right?”  You thrust your hips forward for a moment, closing your eyes for a split of a second.  “If you don’t stop,” you groaned. “I’m gonna cum right here right now.”  Your boyfriend smirked.  “Well, you better do it silently, then,” he pressed your clit a bit harder and you contained a yelp. “The waiter is coming to see if we need anything else.” *~*TEXT*~*

He was going to literally dive into that poosi. And that's what he did.  "Ahn~!!" Her back arched at the sudden full feeling, which only grew as the redhead submerged himself further, every inch of his body rubbing against her g-spot.  Soon, his whole body was in her, and he curled up in her womb as she panted, feeling full and content. He was her child now.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Macs are very good for many things, but PC's are excellent for those who can't afford Apple Macintosh and who simply want to download porn. Mac demonstrates this with PC. A drabble based on the British commercials with Mitchell and Webb. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*"I'm a PC..."  "And I'm a Mac."  "I'm very good for downloading porn," PC snorted, appearing even more of a nerd than ever beside his handsome counterpart.  "Viruses, spyware, and everything else that comes with it," his friend scoffed.  "Yeah but still, most of the British population are complete perverts, and that's what they want."  "Actually I agree," Mac smiled, "Horny people  really  need PC's."  "Do they need them  right now? "  Without further ado, Mac began to unbutton himself, a man desperate for relief. He pushed PC down to the floor. And to think he'd never understood why it was called a  hard-drive  - or why they did away with  floppies  years ago. Reaching into a pair of trendy ripped jeans, the modern style of all new Apples, PC combed through curls of blonde pubic hair to find his already aching penis. Making sure not to  crash  at such a crucial moment, he slowly worked him up to a climax with a level of competence like no other.  PC rolled back on his knees, "Macs are fantastic for home use, for simplicity and reliability..."  "But when all you really need is a good wank, just buy a PC," Mac added, smirking. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Severus doesn't mind Gryffindor colours now and then, when he has lost a bet. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Even though they are both well into their second century, Severus and Minerva have  both remained competitive, sexually active and very much in love with each other. They love betting and, when he loses, Severus does not mind a Gryffindor evening. The Houses have been abolished in Hogwarts but both Severus and Minerva still feel a sense of belonging with their original Houses and love their House colours. So when she has won a bet, they retire to bed early and Minerva gets to read a tale or two from their privately printed copy of  Beedle the Bawd  to Severus to get them in the mood. For those nights, their bedroom is decked in Gryffindor red and gold. Obviously, there are ribbons and bows, too, which will play their role in what unfolds then. Sometimes, Severus cheats and lets Minerva win, so they can have a Gryffindor evening.  *~*TEXT*~*

It had been a long path for them to reach here, so long, and Obi-Wan simply wanted to bask in the warmth of his former master's love. Qui-Gon's massive hands stroked his back and flank, and he whispered quiet nothings as they cuddled in the soft bed. Obi-Wan silenced his embarrassing praise with a deep kiss. He wasn't anywhere near as wonderful as Qui-Gon seemed to think, but safe in this embrace, he almost didn't care that the whispers were absurd— if kindly meant— lies.   *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Sirius and Hermione decide to try something new on their honeymoon. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Sirius moaned, tossing his head side to side in complete ecstasy. He had to admit that he had been a bit squeamish about doing this at first, but he definitely like the effect it was having on him.  It was their honeymoon and they had agreed to try out some different techniques, positions and kinks. Right now, they were trying out Sitophilia, also known as food fetish. Hermione had made a trail of chocolate syrup from the base of Sirius' neck, all the way down to his prominent erection.  It was driving him crazy; Hermione's lips and tongue traveling down his body, licking the chocolate off his body, toying with him. Hermione had just dipped her tongue into his navel when he let out a gasp and came all over her chest.   His newlywed wife sat up, straddling his hips, chuckling. "Well, no one said it was going to be clean and simple." Looking at Hermione's cum-covered breasts, it didn't take him long to become aroused once more. "Ah," She smiled cheekily, "I see that you're ready for round two…" *~*TEXT*~*

Through the hallways, past door upon closed door, to the science classroom where the light was on. Mrs Murawski, like most teachers, had stayed late after school had let out.  Unlike most teachers, her reasons for doing so did not involve her students.  This night, she lay back on her handmade oak desk, long skirt hiked up around her waist, fingers rubbing between her slick folds, and she thought only of the solid wood below her.

*~*TEXT*~*The night was unusually humid and his parents had gone back into the house for bed over an hour ago. Sirius, with his sly smile, had told him he looked rather hot, and should be cooled down. Remus, with rather a clean mind, hadn't thought that Sirius planned to do what he did.  Remus lay on the concrete beside the pool, his legs dangling in the water. His hands were tangled in Sirius' long, wet hair, guiding Sirius' mouth to take his length deeper. It was rather a challenge to keep silent since he was quite the screamer. But he liked challenges. Besides, he didn't want his parents to find them like… this.  He stifled a moan as he came in Sirius's mouth. Exhausted, he lay there as Sirius cleaned them up to be presentable. His lover climbed out of the pool, a wide grin on his face. "Did I cool you down enough?"  He shook his head. "No, opposite effect, I'm afraid."  "Damn." Sirius snapped his fingers. "Better luck next time, eh? *~*TEXT*~*

He asked when he began massaging a particular spot.  "Sensual."   Sirius laughed. "Do you want a happy ending?"  "Sounds like a good idea."  He flipped Remus onto his back. Together they pulled off Remus' boxer shorts. Sirius quickly engulfed Moony's length, his cheeks hallowing as he sucked. Remus had curled his fingers in Padfoot's long hair, tightening his grip when he could feel his cock touch the back of Sirius' throat. He cried out as his spunk shot into his lover's mouth.  As Remus began catching his breath, Sirius crawled up beside him, kissing his cheek. "Did you have a happy ending?"  "Best bloody happy ending ever!" Remus sighed, happily. *~*TEXT*~*

Even if you had told me a couple months ago, I wouldn't have ever thought I'd be here on a nude beach."  Charlie leaned back onto his forearms, smiling up at the sky. "Especially on our honeymoon, huh? See," he playfully punched Hermione's shoulder. "I told you this place would be fun."  Hermione set her heavy book aside and curled up against Charlie. She caressed his bare abs, tracing his muscles, and reached down to grasp his cock, pumping it. She smiled as he moaned, throwing his head back, letting himself go. "Cum for me, Charlie," Hermione breathed into his ear. She gasped as she watched him hold back his cry as he came all over them and their beach towel. Hermione grabbed her wand, casting a simple cleaning spell.   "Wow," was all Charlie could let out. He smiled up at his wife, who was looming over him. He reached up, one hand twisted in her bushy hair, the other cupping her cheek, and began to kiss her fiercely. "Glad no one is near us, huh?" *~*TEXT*~*

Draco entered her throbbing passage, pumping his thick cock in and out with great speed. He grabbed her left breast, pinching the nipple hard, then gently caressing it. Ginny rolled her head back, letting a stream of moan escape from her redden lips. His grey eyes widened as his cunt clenched itself around his member as she quietly came. Not long after, he gritted his teeth has his cum flooded Ginny's swollen cunt.  Gasping, he dropped his head onto her shoulder, their breath in sync with the other's.   "Remind me," Ginny huffed, "...of how amazing this was the next time I don't want to have sex in your office." *~*TEXT*~*

The soldier moaned, and Lord Commander cackled a bit.  "You vowed your allegiance to me, correct?" Lord Commander said.  "Clearly, you do as  I  command."  The soldier looked at him with pleading eyes, only making Lord Commander push it in even further.  Lord Commander twitched a bit, and moaned. A shot of semen had been ejected into the soldier's mouth. Lord Commander took his penis out of the soldier's mouth, and laughed.  " Good boy ." *~*TEXT*~*

Steiner, put out one of the classics of Trek fanzines: THE SENSUOUS VULCAN. Copies are traded and read everywhere throughout fandom and a few can still be found for sale at prices up to $50.00 per copy. Although the title of this 150 plus page volume hints at the adult content, the impact of the varied offerings of short stories, long stories, poetry and art must be FELT, as well as read, to be fully appreciated. What's in THE SENSUOUS VULCAN? Spock, naturally, and most of the other characters from the ENTERPRISE, Vulcan, and many new faces. There are scenes of danger, of serenity, or respite, and of total confusion. Sensuality, sexuality, and sex abound, but contents of pure and delicate love between sensual beings are also seen. Readers of THE SENSUOUS VULCAN will find nearly every type of sexual encounter described within its covers, ranging from mindless rape through sexual innocence to the kind of love that does not require sexual expression. Spock is involved in the vast majority of these situations.."  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Joanne is a new Domme and Maureen is nobody's idea of a sub but it works for them. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Joanne smiles as she opens the gag's buckle. She kisses Maureen's cheek, pulling the ball free. Sliding her hand between Maureen's legs Joanne pushes two fingers inside her, pressing her thumb against her sub's clit.  "Can you take another, baby?"  "Yes."  Moving her thumb in circles she varies the pressure a little watching Maureen's reaction. She's biting her lip in an effort to stay quiet and grinding down on Joanne's fingers, trying to squeeze them.  "Make me come please."  "Should have kept you gagged."  "I'm sorry, I'm trying."  Maureen sounds pretty genuine but letting her come now would set a bad precedent. Joanne pulls her fingers free and holds them up for Maureen to lick clean. "You've been so good but I need you to follow the rules, baby. One day I want to be able to keep you quiet without a gag, after all that mouth has some wonderful uses."  After deeming her fingers clean enough Joanne stands and hitches up her skirt to pull off her panties. Maureen shuffles forward on her knees and puts her hands behind her back.  "You've come twice tonight, time to thank me."  Maureen smiles and eagerly pushes her head between Joanne's thighs. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*“He wants something,” Mage said. “He wants something very badly, and in his dark desire, he is willing to use any means. Violence is not his first choice, but it might come to that, if we don’t find him. Whatever he wants, he desires, he needs. I can feel it.” Arthur cocked his head. “Would eternal life be the sort of thing you’re thinking of?”  Tristan turned to stare at him.  “You have an idea, then?” Sir Bedivere asked.  Arthur shrugged. “So there was this knight…”  (Or: Arthur was getting married to someone else. Sadly, that turned out to be the least of Tristan’s problems.)     Written by  Elareine . *~*SUMMARY*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*molly hurts, and he wants to hurt. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Molly hurts a lot on the inside. Most of the time, the hurt is bearable, a whisper he can tune out. Sometimes though, the hurt is unignorable, and in these times, he turns to hurt. Physical hurt.  He wishes he could tell truths about himself that aren't needs. Like a whine of want when a stranger in a foreign tavern tugs his tail out of the way and fucks his ass roughly. Like a "Please," when Yasha asks him to eat her out on cold, stone floor, as if it isn't a command.   Molly loves seeing his own blood when he doesn't have to fight with it. It reminds him that his body serves purpose other than to fight. It's a reminder he needs more than often.   Sometimes he imagines that with someone, he could talk openly and freely and be who he is. But for now, a choked "Yes," when Caleb checks in worriedly after digging nails deep enough into the tiefling's back to draw blood is more of himself than he is comfortable revealing. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*200-word drabble. Victoria finds a naughty use for the Doctor's sonic screwdriver, but it's hard to find privacy on the Tardis. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*  Victoria was alone at last. Sitting on the edge of her bed, she inspected the object clutched in her hand. It was a slim silver cylinder with a small lightbulb at one end. She tinkered with the device until it lit up, emitting a high-pitched whirr.    Tentatively lifting her skirt, Victoria pressed the sonic screwdriver between her legs. Even through her white cotton panties she could feel it buzzing pleasantly. Her breath quickened; her hips began to squirm.      "Knock knock," said Jamie, not waiting to open the door.    Victoria hurriedly covered herself, clenching the device between trembling thighs.    "There you are," said Jamie. "We hadn't seen you for a while. The Doctor sent me to check you're okay."      "I'm fine," said Victoria, trying to maintain the facade of innocence.      "Are ye sure?" asked Jamie. "You look a wee bit red..."      "Fine, really," insisted Victoria, stifling a moan.      "If yer sure," said Jamie as he shut the door. He lingered outside for a moment, listening.      "Ah Jamie, there you are!" said the Doctor. He was patting his pockets distractedly. "I seem to have lost my sonic screwdriver. Have you seen it?"      "Cannae help ye, sorry Doctor. Why don't you ask Victoria?" *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“There, that’s better.” Marlena gave a pat to Nyota’s cheek and stroked a glossy black thumbnail along her trembling jaw as she admired her contraption: The lieutenant’s mouth crammed with a dark ball-gag soaked in the drool dribbling down to her chin, her arms stretched to form a T with her body, ropes wrapped around her wrists whose barbs dug into her skin, cruel clamps with the insignia of the Empire latched onto her nipples and attached by a beaded string, and her eyes wide open in terror, darting from her smug captor to the entranced audience of crewmembers--male, female, everyone and everything--stopped in the hallway to gawk at her shame:  Her legs pried open and shoved into heavy metal shackles far apart from each other, goosebumps dotting her bare thighs and waist, and an oversized, barbed fleshy dildo attached to a small machine in the booth shoving itself into the lieutenant’s cunt, dragging its rubber along her folds and smearing with juices upon each entry and exit.  Marlena’s finger waded down to Uhura’s clit, giving it a hard pinch. “If you try to escape to your universe ever again, you’ll be getting a lot worse than this.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Copia eyed where Three's throat had connected, admiring the way it glistened with congealing blood and was obscenely beautiful.   Copia stuck his hardened cock into Three's esophagus, or at least, what had once been his esophagus.   He moved the head up and down his cock, laughing quietly when he noticed that his cock was opening Three's mouth ever so slightly. He moaned, watching his lifeless eyes roll as his thrusts increased and he tightened his grip on Three’s immaculate hair.   Copia pulled out before he came, moaning at the blood smeared on his cock and came, letting his cum mix with Three's blood in an obscene mixture that Copia desperately wanted to taste.   He swiped a little bit up with his finger and brought it to his mouth, suckling on the digit and moaning at the taste of life and death, of cum and blood, of something so obscenely wrong, yet so delicious and delicate. *~*TEXT*~*

By now the floor is red as I go over my two thighs. I have so many red lines littering the spread.   I go to my stomach. Dragging the razor blade over the bottom. I wince, going faster.  I need more. More pain.. My wrist. I go down and across. Making x's and patterns till I feel like I'm going to die.   I deserve this all, right?     *~*TEXT*~*

Vanquished by lips that seared away the facade leaving a truth as naked as the both of them, expressed in hands as heavy as her breaths. Foster's hips curled, requesting more. More of this. More of her.  She writhed, words lifting into the air and drenching Sloane in a sticky, satiated contentment witnessed by only them, and enjoyed only in this fleeting microcosm.  "No...” Foster purred, taking Sloane's wrists. She pinned them above Sloane's head and grinned. “My turn.” *~*TEXT*~*

Scott finds it comforting that Mason could tell exactly what he was fishing for. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*雷狮在太阳即将落山的时候来到了精灵之森的边缘，他穿着随意的便装，头巾在空中飞舞。精灵族居住于森林深处，但是边缘的小湖旁，一阵精灵少年少女的欢笑随风传来。  雷狮靠近如同宝石般的湖泊，精灵之森中处处有灵，他身周的草木纷纷向他示意问好，高大的树木抖动着枝桠向两边倾斜，露出一条精致的小路。雷狮踩上圆润的鹅卵石，路的尽头有人听到树叶摩挲的声音停下了手里的动作，直起身来，转头看向了这边。  年少的精灵们顺着路欢声笑语地走来，他们从雷狮身边擦过，不曾畏惧亦未有好奇。安迷修站在路的尽头，手上捧着一大束野花，回过头来看向雷狮。他清澈透亮的眼睛在夕阳的余晖中展现出多重的色彩。他穿着精灵族常见的长袍，赤足站在草地上，裸露的后背上一双透明的翅膀安静地低垂着，能隐约看见线条优美的脊椎。雷狮加快了脚步，不长的小路很快走完，安迷修转过身来，看向这个靠近的身影。  雷狮停在他的面前，伸手撩起安迷修鬓边微长的头发，年轻的精灵脸上的绯红蔓延到耳根，他捧起手中的这束野花，送到雷狮面前。安迷修把脸偏向一侧，支支吾吾地表示今天是雷狮的生日，他没有什么家当，只能以此聊表心意。夕阳为他的侧脸和头发染上金边，碧绿的瞳孔中也呈现出经过折射破碎的金色。雷狮的漆黑的双翼出现在他背后，伴随着西沉的明日、明亮的月光缓缓展开。他捏着安迷修的下巴把他的脸转过来，深邃的紫眸锁定了安迷修的双眼，他笑着说道：诞生于光明的精灵居然献花给堕天使，你知道这是什么罪名吗？  安迷修张了张嘴没有回答，伸手就把花扔在了雷狮身上，没有仔细绑好的花叶散开，随着轻柔的晚风散落在两人身上，雷狮用翅膀将两人包裹起来，花瓣在这个小小的空间里飞舞，在雷狮的微微发力下落向安迷修的发间身上。  接着便是伴随着花香的一个吻，雷狮捏着安迷修下巴的手贴着皮肤一路滑到精致的锁骨最后按在了后颈，另一只手搂住他的后腰。为了方便翅膀的展开，精灵族在森林中穿着的长袍是露背的，雷狮放在安迷修后腰的手正好停在衣服的边缘，指尖毫不避讳地抚摸着裸露在外的肌肤，几乎让安迷修站不住。  他保持着深吻的姿态，将安迷修的长袍下摆拉起，直接撕了袍子下面的底裤。安迷修不满地发出一声鼻音，挣开了雷狮绵长的亲吻。雷狮却没有放他离开，双唇依旧紧贴在一起，原本放在后颈的手顺着脊柱抚过敏感的翅膀根部，最后和另一只手一起握住了安迷修的腰。他顺势坐在了草地上，安迷修感觉到股间的炙热，搂着雷狮脖子的手又紧张地收紧了一分。  雷狮贴着安迷修的嘴唇轻轻地说道：我活了千万年早就不记得什么生日了，你又是从哪里知道的？  安迷修避开他炙热的呼吸和嘴唇地摩擦，回答道：今天是传说中创世的日子，你是与世界一起诞生的才对……话音未落雷狮不知什么时候转移到安迷修屁股上的手狠狠地捏了一把，一声不大的呻吟打断了安迷修的话。  光明的精灵，我要进入你。雷狮低沉的声音带着笑意在他耳边响起，一根手指已经带着元素凝成的水液探入了后穴，并且很快找到了安迷修的敏感点。过电的快感让他挺直了腰，藤蔓状的耳饰伴随着扬起头的动作在雷狮的余光里飞舞。不算仔细的扩张之后雷狮就肏了进去，被一寸寸撑开穴肉的感觉太过磨人，安迷修压抑的呻吟在雷狮耳边响起，他停留在安迷修臀肉上的手猛的收紧，逼得安迷修的呻吟又拔高了一个度。雷狮的头巾也被安迷修拽落，再睁开眼睛时变得直立的瞳孔更具攻击力，指甲也染上墨色，陷在柔软的臀肉中显得画面越发淫靡。对这份快感过分熟悉的精灵很快适应了称得上粗暴的抽插，他坦诚地向爱人展示自己所有敏感点，不再压抑自己的呻吟。  雷狮双手用力，在顶入最深处的时候收拢了安迷修的臀瓣，过多的快感逼出了精灵的眼泪，他试图逃离却只能离雷狮越来越近，双手死死抓着雷狮背后的衣服，带着哭腔的呻吟声刺激得雷狮又加大了力度。他低头用唇舌玩弄着安迷修的乳首，让浅色的乳头颤栗着勃起，染上糜烂的艳红。叠加的快感仿佛电流流淌在每一寸皮肤，安迷修几乎要以为雷狮动用了雷元素。他半透明的翅膀在身后绷紧展开，迷茫地颤抖着。雷狮用手掐住翅膀和身体连接的根部，安迷修张开嘴却没能发出声音，敏感的神经被手指的掐弄唤醒，几乎吞噬了他全部的意识。雷狮一边更加用力地肏他，一边将双翼合拢，翅膀尖端的羽毛和安迷修精灵的翅尖暧昧地摩擦着。几乎是在两者触碰的刹那安迷修就释放了，绞紧的穴肉也给了雷狮极大的快感，他没有忍耐，深深地顶入，射在了安迷修体内。  光明的造物瘫软在堕天使怀里，身上遍布着性爱过后的淫液。精灵虽然不能驱使光元素使用光魔法，血肉中却蕴含着与生俱来的光明，雷狮巨大的黑色羽翼包裹着二人，而安迷修就是这狭窄空间里唯一的光。与堕天使结合的精灵没有堕化为黑暗精灵，依旧保有在黑暗中微微发光的身躯。在他怀中无力地喘息着的精灵满脸泪痕，眼角发红，汗湿的头发贴在脸侧。雷狮看着他，又一次吻上去。  雷狮诞生于暗世界，是暗世界唯一的君主，而这就是他为黑夜捕获的光。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Legend says in Bahrain never rains. The statement becomes invalid with the involvement of pain. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*When Maurizio presses Kimi against a corner of the bedroom, he gets an opportunity of justifying Saturday's mistakes.  Cupping both sides of the most perfect face he has ever seen in sixty-one years, they share enviable kisses, tasting together the flavor of tears.  Rushing, round one happens on bed, rematch on the shower. Hushing, the older tries to silenciate the explicitness whilst bruising Kimi's neck.  Mentally questioning if the driving task remained a job or a manipulation involving sex and crazy amounts of money, nothing else matters.   No breaks, just breaking it off.   Hierarchy was undoubtedly the sweetest with pornography. *~*TEXT*~*

Spread your legs.”  Lily obeyed, gasping as he thrust in, fucking her steadily until she convulsed, her cunt rippling around him until he emptied inside her.  Hugo collapsed on top of her. “Amazing.” Lily laughed. “I’ll say. What inspired that?”  Glancing out the window at the industrial pipes that constituted their view, Hugo smirked. “Nothing but you, my love.”   ~ *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*01  "呼……怎么样……"  房间里昏昏暗暗的，壁灯开着，黄光从上头浇下来，在两人身上晕开。喻文州躺在底下，叶修跨在他身上，匀称的肌肉上抹了一层汗，在灯光底下成一片模糊的金色。  喻文州年轻体健，腰上的劲儿也足，两手扶着叶修的腰侧，下体猛烈地颠动着。叶修虽说是身居上位，但这会儿身心都臣服了，十指掰着自己的股缝，嘴唇张得很圆，黏黏的水丝挂在唇角，面上显出沉溺的迷醉。  "好大……唔……"  这个体位进得深，喻文州的尺寸也很不错，龟头插准了宫口，顶在肉腔深处磨动着，好像要突破了那条狭缝的阻碍似的。  叶修腰软得立不住，颤巍巍地弯下腰，两手撑在喻文州胸口。发情期的omega浪得吓人，情动的时候信息素成倍的释放，把整个房间都泡在里面，可惜的是喻文州一点也闻不到——他是个钝感的beta。  喻文州把他的上半身拉下来，捧着他的脸颊，温柔细致的亲吻落在他脖子后面。喻文州一边亲一边问道："是你这儿吗？"  beta没有气味腺，也没有alpha咬omega脖子的本能，喻文州只能自己用唇舌探索着，一寸寸地沿着他的颈侧吻下去。腺体附近的皮肤敏感非常，他的嘴唇刚刚盖上那块地方，叶修就情不自禁地抖了抖。  "嗯……"叶修被他吮得不能自已，颈子抖动着，身上的皮肤蒸出些肉粉色，"别……不要吸……"  "亲对地方了？"喻文州顶着他的穴心，享受着水穴一波波的紧缩，"那我再给你弄弄……"  "啊……"  叶修下体抽动了几下，屁股沉下来，高潮时狭缝格外的脆弱，这一下子差点就把喻文州吞了进去。两人被这种前所未有的快感搞得头皮发麻，喻文州索性两手把叶修架起来上下抛动，借着这股力道顶弄他的宫口。  "叶修……叶修……"喻文州在他耳边轻声叫着，粗重的呼吸喷在颈子上，"快了吗？"  "嗯、嗯……"  他只仰着脸，嘴唇都没张开，只是喉咙里溢出又短又急的气音，胸部上下起伏着。虽然喻文州弄得他高潮连连，但没有alpha的信息素抚慰他、没有阴茎结死死卡住他，发情期的潮热始终无法被平息。  他现在已经软成一滩，两人胸膛贴着胸膛，全靠喻文州扳着他的屁股从底下插他，连两眼都跟着发直。明天文州还要上班……不能做得太晚……叶修迷迷糊糊想着，费力地从喻文州身上翻下来。粗壮的肉具从洞里脱出来的时候还挂着些水丝，涨红发紫的一根。  "叶神，怎么了？"喻文州这发还没出，从叶修身后抱住他柔软的腰，阴茎埋在股缝里贴着穴口摩擦。  "明天上班……睡吧……"叶修嘴上这么说，臀部却不由自主地向后拱着，把湿润的肉缝贴紧了喻文州的腰。两人就着这个青蛙抱对的姿势抱着摩擦了一会儿，叶修觉得还是痒，里面的淫肉不肯放过，吸着缠着，最后还是把喻文州给勾进去了。  一般第二次都比第一次持久些，喻文州出在里面的时候，已经不知是什么时候了。喻文州是真累，仰面在床上躺着。叶修倒是爽快了，从里到外都满足得不行，眯着眼睛趴在床上，一手攀在喻文州肩膀上，另一手拿着烟，一口一口嘬着，神情十分惬意。  "哎，文州……"  喻文州不理他，叶修偏头，发现他已经睡熟了，便拉过被子来，把灯关上了。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*     [public to Citadel]  I didn't let myself post yesterday because I feared it'd be nothing but depressing word vomit, all over the keyboard.  The fact is, Chris Cornell was a major musical influence on me. Soundgarden rose right as I rioted into adolescence, providing a big chunk of the soundtrack for my formative teen years. He was a fantastically talented lyricist, songwriter, singer, musician, performer. I'm still in shock.   Every word I said is what I mean    Everything I gave is what I need  Everything I held is what I freed  And everything I've shown is what I feel                 Buying lies and stealing jokes    Now I know why you've been taken   - Soundgarden, "Slaves and Bulldozers"  RIP Chris *~*TEXT*~*

And Ryan felt it would be ridiculously wasteful to buy a new Christmas tree each time Sam's shoot changes location. So instead he's gotten into the habit of buying a nice potted African Violet with each new suite, and when it's time to go, he leaves it for the Housekeeping staff. This morning he moved the violets to a prominent place on the bureau, and conspicuously left a large cream-colored envelope sitting just beneath. Inside are two concert tickets for  2Cellos , and a note: Sam,  I know classical music has never been your thing, but you are going to love this concert, I promise.

*~*TEXT*~*~ Birthday Suit ~ Harry arched, taking Snape deeper while Snape clutched Harry’s hips, fucking in and out of Harry roughly. He’d have bruises for days, not that Harry minded.  What he  did  mind was being naked while Snape’s robes chafed his skin.  “Close?” Snape gasped, speeding up.  “Yeah.”  Harry stroked his cock faster, vision blurring as he came, trembling as Snape shuddered, spilling inside him.  When Snape withdrew, Harry sighed, reaching for his clothes. Snape cleared his throat. “You…may stay, if you like.”  Turning around, Harry smiled. “Sure. Can we both be naked this time?”  Slowly, Snape nodded. “That would be acceptable.”  ~ *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Written for the prompt: ""Bearded!Steve going down on Natasha would be an Easter miracle at my house ;)"" *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Normally, she has much better control than this. She was once the pride of the Red Room, and there was no position she could not sit in for hours without movement, if needed. There are gargoyles in at least two cities that have the right to be jealous of her ability to not move.  But has she not remained still for two years? Has she not held her breath for two years? She allows herself to release that breath, as Steve Rogers slides himself between her legs.  And with that breath, she releases all control she normally keeps bottled up, and perhaps he is able to catch it as it escapes her. She wriggles impatiently against the bed and tugs impatiently against the too-long, barely-blond hair at her fingertips. His beard is as delightfully irritating against the smooth skin of her thighs as it had been against her lips and breasts, and Natasha has no doubt that each turn of his head is designed to make her clasp her legs more tightly together.  Each movement of his head is purposeful, his cunning move to elicit her desperate cries for mercy that she does not mean and he does not give. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Celebrian can't wait. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*       'Not now, please I still have work to-  Elrond can hardly contest. Celebrian's deft hands fishes him out and she wraps her fingers around his member, holding him steady until she sheathes him completely with her heat.   'Sorry, you were saying?  'She teases, twirling her hips. Her rich blue eyes are glinting with mirth and mischief.   'Naughty little nymph.'  Elrond complains to himself, the words floating through his mind incoherently as Celebrian sets to riding his cock in her shimmering spring gown.  'My   office is the last place we should be doing this!'   She peers down into his steel greys, her eyes darkening as she pluck the thought from his mind.     'I heard that'  Celebrian bows her golden head down to bite at his neck. Nipping and sucking as she fucks him with a whimsical wildness.  When Elrond is finally making enough noise to her liking, she clenches, her sex stroking along his shaft until a long resounding groan fills the room. Pumping steady pulses of his essence, Elrond pours himself into her. He can't help to wonder as he lift his lips to hers, how on Arda did he lose control of the situation-and of himself.     ~Fin~ *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Jack and Gabriel have a secret. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*It was hard for Gabriel to keep him all to himself. Especially when he could see that the way other Overwatch agents looked at their Strike Commander. Any one of them would be jealous if they knew what kind of relationship he and Jack Morrison had behind closed doors. “Gabriel,” The blonde’s voice, desperate and wanting is enough to send shivers down his lover’s spine. “Gabriel, please I can’t-” His pleads break off with a helpless whine as he begins to come again, body shaking as his seed drips to the floor. Gabriel grins at the sight of his handiwork. Jack’s arms are tied tightly behind his back, with his ankles bound to the legs of his desk. He has a jet black, vibrating butt plug buried deep in his ass. It is one of the biggest that Gabriel has seen, its thickest point just about the size of the dark-haired man's fist, vibrating frantically over his lovers prostate. It is perfect for a slut like Morrison. “You can,” Gabriel responds with a twisted smile, revealing in the way that his commander shakes and cries from the overwhelming pleasure. “One more time, sunshine. Come one more time for me.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*3（上）  Sebastian想过这件事。关于他和Chris。他也不知道是从什么时候开始的，是从谁开始的，那些隔着人群望过来的眼神，不期而至的碰触，不经意地微笑，挑眉，眨眼，突然有了比原本多得多的涵义。  有东西在他们之间流转。他感觉到欲望。  第一次在片场看到穿紧身制服的Chris，当晚就想着那倒三角的背影和又窄又翘的屁股撸了一发。  他以前从没以那种角度想过一个男性，从性的角度。  他看女人，带着欣赏，常常也夹杂着欲望；看男人，难免带着比较。打飞机的时候，他想的是女朋友，有时是Sharon Stone，他青少年时期的性感女神。在夜店他只看女人的胸和屁股，只对女人露出那种眼尾上挑、嘴角微翘的——他知道大部分女人都抗拒不了的——挑逗微笑。  他从没想要亲吻一个男性，从没想着一个男人的胸肌和屁股、还有那该死的红彤彤的嘴唇，勃起。  Chris就像他再平常不过的走在路上，拐个弯却突然横在他面前的一座山。他抬头，有洪流从山上劈头盖脸奔涌而来，他在山下，既惊恐万状又目眩神迷；他转身逃回原路，山却也在他来的路上。  越不过，绕不开。他假作无视继续前行，开始还小心翼翼，但山的阴影始终相伴，一忽儿在左，一忽儿在右，有时将他全身裹挟住，渐渐地他竟然开始对山露出那种眼尾上挑、嘴角微翘的挑逗笑容。  有时他猛然意识到自己正在挑逗一个男人，忙不迭杀住笑，眼神僵硬地撇向别处，或者干脆转开头，慌张的样子藏都藏不住。Anthony好几次发现了，眼神在他和Chris之间一转，贼兮兮地问：“搞什么你们？”  他也不知道他们在搞什么。可能就因为他们什么也没“搞”，张力累计无处发泄，两人间的气氛才如此怪异。  其实他也不是总在想“搞”这件事的，有时他想的就只是牵手亲嘴逛马路，抱在一起数星星，仿佛情窦初开的十五六。  至少从性别来看，他对Chris的确是情窦初开。至少是，情欲初开。  Chris的嘴唇，想亲吻；Chris的发丝，想抚弄；Chris的衣服，想撕掉；Chris的手臂前胸后背大腿屁股，想舔舐吻咬，想感受那些肌肉绷紧或颤抖的样子。  他想上Chris。  幸运的是，他的欲望不是单方面的；不幸的是，从第一次合作开始，他就感受到了Chris超强的掌控欲。即使Chris总是表现得热情随和，但不经意间的眼神，揉捏他后颈的手掌，还有对他说“集中注意”时的语气——每次听到他都忍不住低眉敛目正襟危坐——都在提醒他Chris绝对不会躺平了任上。  Chris也想上他。  而且，他打不过Chris。他认真对比过两人的武力值，脑子里演练过，练习室里也实际动手过。从第一部戏开始，Chris就练得比他结实，格斗训练也比他多，在争夺主动权上他真是一点儿胜算也没有。所以，他只好避着Chris，和Chris“不太熟”，免得闻得到肉香吃不到嘴难受，也免得引火烧身。  然而到了第二部电影，他想避也避不开了。大量的格斗戏让他们的肢体接触数量级上升，无论是在片场内还是片场外。他们进行大量的配合练习，把整体拆分开变成独立的片段，把空间、力量、速度融入进去，缠斗间再变成连贯的整体*。  就像和另一个人共舞*。  第一部戏的他们是这只舞的前半程，充满你来我往你进我退的试探，他本想就此停住，但第二部戏却一下子把他们带入激烈昂扬的后半程，试探变成了追逐，闪避倒成了欲拒还迎。舞步旋转，每一次肢体交缠、身躯相贴，都把欲望推高再推高；再旋转，他们汗如雨下面红耳赤心如擂鼓。  每一次打戏的预演都成了床戏的预演。  他不是没挣扎过，他简直是进行了垂死挣扎。做不到不想，至少可以不听不看不接触，他开始和Chris更不熟，除了拍摄和对练，通通避着Chris走。即使在对练中性起了无数次，必须遮遮掩掩逃回房间打手枪，即使两人抱着摔在练习垫上Chris气喘吁吁张着嘴同时还张着腿，他也没心一横放任自己亲上去。即使旁边一个人也没有。   他本以为可以挨过拍摄期。  但Chris显然比自己更高明。  他也开始和自己不熟了。  没有似笑非笑的对望了。没有冷不丁的拍胸摸背了。没有往他后颈捏的手了。也没有片场内片场外黏着他闹个没完了。  剧组一群人聚会，以前挨着他坐现在隔着三四个人整晚一个眼神都吝啬。  他闷头闷脑的坐在那喝酒，Anthony凑上来问：“怎么了你们？”  “啊？那个，”他绞着脑汁想拎出个像样的理由，“保持情绪，你知道吧，就是队长和冬兵，你懂呀，他们得保持对抗，这叫入戏你知道吧。”  果然一口一个“你知道”出卖了他，对着Anthony他一向挺顺溜的。Anthony觑着他：“编，继续编。”  “真的，看我的眼神，”他聚拢眉峰看过去，“是不是比以前更有杀气了。”  “比以前更有怨气了。”  他捶Anthony一下。一抬眼，Chris正看向这边。  眼神冷冰冰的。  他还没想好要摆个什么表情，Anthony先端着酒站了起来：“我还是坐你远点，有人的眼神可真的有杀气。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*2（上）  他们就这样搞到了一起，虽然结局和Sebastian原本打算的不大一样。  不，是大不一样。  Sebastian窝回椅子里，腿往两边一岔，下巴点着自己的裆部。  “你打算怎么操翻我？你的嘴吗？”  Chris歪着嘴笑，手扣住桌沿，二头肌鼓起，把小桌推到一旁。Sebastian喝过的那只玻璃杯倒下来，咕噜噜滚过桌面，停到另一只还立着的杯子旁。  Chris喝的那只杯子。  Chris也往椅子里一靠，手肘搁到两边扶手上。  “Sebastian”，他脸上一点笑也没有了，“过来，跪下，吸我。”  严厉的语气让Sebastian一抖。  这可不是他的打算。他的打算是先操翻Chris那张总是粉红粉红的小嘴，然后再操翻他说不定也是粉红粉红的屁股。  Sebastian恼怒地瞪着Chris。Chris两手交叠，射过来的目光沉甸甸的。  Sebastian又抖了一下。这回主要是老二。  就先让他爽一下，谁让自己一会要操他呢。Sebastian最终盘算着，起身来到Chris面前。  Chris抬头，蓝眼睛中似有无尽爱恋。Sebastian心头一跳，觉得自己不是跪倒，而是软倒在了地毯上。  仰视的变成了Sebastian，他再看Chris，俯视中只有威严和命令。  角度作祟。他想。他不知道自己的眼里都有什么，但他让自己充满挑衅和挑逗。  眼帘微垂，眼尾上挑，嘴唇扬起的角度恰到好处。  果然，Chris鼻翼扩张，眼睛也眯了起来。  “别怪我没说，”Sebastian掏出Chris的老二，“我口活估计不怎么样。”他是吸过很多男人的舌头，可还从来没吸过别人的老二。  Chris不为所动，手放到他后颈捏了捏，力度不大，温度却烫人。  “张嘴。”他下令。  Sebastian张开嘴。  “包住牙齿。”  Sebastian包住牙齿。  “含住。”  Sebastian把那根粗壮的玩意儿含进嘴里。  简直他妈的像个声控机器人。Sebastian在心里怒骂自己，他妈的着了什么魔！  Chris声粗气促，继续发令：“舔。”  他就舔了起来。  好吧，好吧。就当是“吃香蕉”好了——他卷起舌头舔了一下，为了一会有“水蜜桃”吃，——心理建设都还没做完，“香蕉”就自己动了起来。  龟头一下子就顶到了嗓子眼里。Sebastian往后撤，按在他后颈的手却让他动弹不得。  Sebastian怒视Chris，Chris又露出那个歪起一边嘴角的笑，把阴茎抽出去了一点。  “继续，Seb.”  Chris的嗓音相当、相当低沉。  Sebastian翻了个白眼，一边在心里感谢所有给他口过的姑娘，大约她们在这件事情上并没有什么快感可言，一边回想得到过的那些口活，调动舌头去舔龟头和马眼。  但是这根香蕉不仅不软不甜，而且也太大了点，满满当当地塞在他嘴里，实在没什么动作的空间。  潦草地吃着嘴里的老二，这吸吸那舔舔，越来越浓重的麝香味在口中弥漫，前列腺液涌到舌头上，和流个没完的口水搅在一起，他还没决定要不要吞掉，盛不下的液体就溢出嘴角，淌了一下巴。  “看看你，”Chris抚上Sebastian湿滑的唇，“含着老二，多么美。”  “一张欠操的嘴。”  沙哑地低喃拂过他周身的每一个毛孔，鬼使神差的，他收紧双颊嘬了那根香蕉一下。  Chris一声闷吟。他撩起眼皮，望着Chris。Chris也对牢了他的视线，低垂的眼睫后似有火焰，和捏在他颈上的手、塞在他嘴里的阴茎一起，点燃他的血。  有什么东西在他的皮肤底下颤栗。  他竟然比姑娘们还要有快感，上帝啊。他一边不安的挪了挪膝盖，一边不由自主地把Chris的阴茎吞得更深。  那根东西涨得比一开始还大，撑得他下巴发酸，他用舌头往外推那玩意，Chris却摆动胯部，往他嘴里抽送起来。Sebastian一下就被噎住了，他本能地去推Chris，还没吃到桃就被香蕉先噎死了，怎么看都不划算。  他瞪着Chris，裹着威胁，但咽反射激出他的眼泪，让他的怒视看上去全是委屈和无助。  Chris咆哮出声。  他一手按牢了Sebastian的后脑，一手捏住Sebastian的下巴，凌厉地抽送起来。Sebastian被噎得直呕，拼命摇头，眼泪溪流似的淌着，他往Chris腿上抓挠，短短的指甲仍然抓破了的皮肤，Chris在疼痛中怒吼着，越发用力地抽插了几下，终于射在了Sebastian嘴里。  Sebastian跌坐在地，扭过身不住干呕。精液溢出嘴角，和泪水交杂，脏污了他的脸颊，  “你，咳咳，”Sebastian一字一停地喘气，“你他妈——你他妈——你他妈操你的Chris.”  Chris抬起Sebastian的下巴，用拇指把精液涂在他肿胀的唇上。  “真美，”他俯身吻住那两片被白色沾染的鲜红，“Seb.你真美。”  “混蛋，”Sebastian攀住Chris的肩膀，他觉得血液里的骚动突然都安静了，“Chris，你真他妈是个混蛋。” *~*TEXT*~*

John has draped himself over Harold's back and is moving very slowly, just barely pulling out, like he can't bear to slip away from Harold's warmth any more than necessary. Grace watches them, leaning in the doorway. They're a beautiful sight, practically glowing with love and relaxation. Her artistic mind is already figuring out how to sketch them. Perhaps she will, when her hands aren't otherwise occupied. *~*TEXT*~*

Grace repositions the hand closest to her, curving it around the back of John's neck. John responds with an appreciative noise, does something with his tongue which causes Harold to shudder and gasp. *~*TEXT*~*

"I thought you were supposed to come home tomorrow."  "I was, yeah. Picked the last train of the night to get here early," he said, walking towards him and getting rid of his clothes. "But you, oh, what are  you  doing, huh? Whatcha watching, Beka?"  Otabek turns his laptop to face Yuri. Two men are moaning while one fucks the other, and Yuri and him haven't got really there, so he asks just in case.  "Would you want that? To fuck me?"  "Yeah, I would. Just if you want it too, though."  Yuri gets on the bed and climbs on Otabek's hips, hand on his chest for balance, and rubs their cocks together, both moaning.  "Oh, I definitely do want to. But another time. Now I'm too horny and not nearly enough patient for that." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*    It was a cloudy grey afternoon, Riolu slept gently by the window to the sound of rainfall. Suddenly, a knock at the door. Riolu stirred from their snoozin' to answer the door.      They opened the door to find Bigweld standing in the rain. No jacket, and holding a bouquet of very very wet flowers, "It was you! It's always been you!"      "Bigweld?" Riolu was in shock, they didn't think they'd ever see Bigweld again. But they hoped... and dreamed... "Bigweld."      "Don't say anything. I killed Dusknoir. It's all over now... we can free! Free together!"      "Bigweld..."      Bigweld rolled up closer to Riolu, "...yeah?" And then,  BOOM!  the kiss.      It was soft, but firm. Warm and inviting, but aloof yet. Riolu wanted more.      They pulled Bigweld in, and started going at it more passionately.      And the rest is way too NSFW ya frickin' pervs! Thanks to that weird Guardian, that is a discord server, for this idea.  *~*TEXT*~*

"That's my boy," Louis murmured, closing his eyes and gripping the cushion as Harry steadily picked up the pace. *~*TEXT*~*

Bruce likes seeing him like this, begging, edging him, on the verge of coming but not letting him. “What do you want, Hal?”  “You,” Hal pants, laying his head on Bruce’s thigh, unable to hold himself up with his hands tied behind his back. He kisses the skin there, leans his cheek so he can look up at Bruce. “Want you. Want to come,”  “You want to fuck me?” Bruce runs a finger over Hal’s other cheek.  “Yeah,” Hal answers breathily. “Want to fuck you,”  “But you have to earn it,” says Bruce airily. “And you don’t deserve fuck me, much less come. Not after the way you flirted with that teenage waiter at the diner today,”  “No! Only you! Please, only you,"   Bruce raises a skeptical brow. He decides to prolong Hal’s punishment.

*~*TEXT*~*"I can't believe I'm letting you do this." Yuri chuckled, grabbing Otabek's ass cheeks with both his hands and giving them a light squeeze.  "Shut up, Beka, I love it when you do it to me, I'm just copying you. You have the right to back off any time though, all right?"  "Yeah, okay," he sighs, as if he was resigned and not incredibly turned on by the idea that his boyfriend is about to lick his ass.  "Relax," Yuri whispers, and that's the only thing Otabek needs to obey.  Yuri starts with small licks and bites on his cheeks, approaching more and more to Otabek's ass and then finally,  finally  going there and probing at it with an insistent tongue.  Otabek is wiggling his ass and moaning before he can stop himself because, damn, it's hot, and he had never experienced something like that before. And then Yuri is stopping, blowing a cold breath over his ass and playfully asking "so, you wanna stop or?"  And Otabek's whining and cursing and "get your sharp tongue back to fucking work, Yuri."  And hey, that was not nice, but Yuri obeys anyways because he was enjoying himself anyways. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Dean's been begging Sam for weeks.   "Please Sammy, talk dirty to me!"   It just made Sam feel inadequate.  Sam had never been a "dirty talker"; but there were dirtybadwrong things in his head. Words he came close to uttering, but, what if it turned Dean off, or worse, he made fun of him?   So while Dean was showering, he gulped down four fingers of whisky and went over different ways to say the words while he took the lube and prepped himself.  He was so psyched, that when a naked Dean came into the room, Sam tackled him onto the bed. "Hiya, Sammy. Miss me?"  "Need you, De! I'm ready". Sam slid his slicked up hole against Dean's hard cock.   Dean then picked Sam up, and slid into him from behind.   "Fuck Sammy, so wet for me!"  "Yeah, give it to me De..Daddy."  Dean slowed his thrusting. "Whatcha say, Sammy?"  Sam turned his head towards Dean, "Shut up, and fuck me, Daddy!"  "Holy fuck, baby boy....I'm gonna... fuckkkkk!" Sam heard behind him as Dean's thrusts grew erratic as he came inside Sam.  "Wow, that was short." Sam smiled at Dean.  "Yeah yeah, now go make Daddy a sandwich!" *~*TEXT*~*

Because there’s something about Clark’s name on frosted glass that turns Bruce on. Clark’s sitting on the sofa and Bruce, facing toward him, straddling him and bouncing like they hadn’t seen each other in weeks. Bruce’s pants are by Clark’s feet, and both of them are sure their clothes are ruined after this. “Mr. Kent?” Clark’s secretary knocks on the door. “I’ve got your itinerary for your visit to Central City,” His lips are on Bruce’s neck and he doesn’t answer immediately. “Thank you, Bethany,” he replies easily. “I’ll review them later,” “Do you like feeling that you might get caught?” Bruce sits on him and breathes. “Do you?” Clark returns the question to him, because honestly, he’d rather do this at home, but when Bruce wants it, his cock rises to the occasion and lives to serve. “I do,” Bruce hums, “Because I know that they know you’re fucking me in here, and I want them to know that you’re  mine ,” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Roy would reach out, trying to ignore the careful, steady tick of the watch that rested on the other side of his body, discarded but not out of reach. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*There were times that should have been labeled afterglow when the air between them was thick enough to cut with a knife, drawing a wall between them even when still covered in the bodily fluids of the other, a mix of semen and sweat that kept them familiar.  Roy would reach out, trying to ignore the careful, steady tick of the watch that rested on the other side of his body, discarded but not out of reach.  And Al would try to smile, blocking out the sound from outside, the children playing ball in the street and screaming their joy much as he'd already exclaimed his.  Neither one of them ever talked about the wall that formed and then dropped minutes later when the afterglow stopped and life began again. Somehow Roy didn't ever think they would. Because the wall had a name. The tension and the thickness in the air.  Loss. Something missing. What they were both aching for.  Roy could hear his watch ticking.  And Al would listen to the youth he didn't have.  For just a bit longer. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*刘总把叶修从被子里拦腰捞出来，叶修浑身上下都汗腻腻的，两只小手还捆着。这次刘总长了记性，两人摆成个观音坐莲的姿势，硕大的阴茎结卡在宫口上下耸动着。叶修张着小嘴，两眼睁着，但快感堆得太高，把他的嗓子都堵住了，什么都叫不出来。 叶修刚成年不久，身子将成未成，生殖道比那些性成熟的O要浅一些。alpha的鸡巴还没全都插进去，就已经顶到了头。况且内腔的肉口更紧、更湿，龟头一陷进去，就好像被什么东西咬住了一样。刘总被他搞得眼睛都红了，也顾不上叶修怎样了，只顾着把自己的鸡巴插得更深些。 …… 虽说刘总撤了，但饭桌上的气氛仍然十分热烈。好不容易把所有赞助商送走，陶轩看一眼表，已经一点多了。他走出电梯，来到了走廊最尽头的房间门前。想着叶修应该睡了，便没有敲门。房卡插进去，门开了，他闻见了一股很浓的信息素气味。 …… "嗯……不……" "呼……要射了……宝贝儿……" 床上颠鸾倒凤的二位显然没有注意到门口的动静，叶修的两腿不知什么时候已经缠到了刘总腰上，脚趾因为过分的快感而蜷缩着。陶轩刚走到玄关处，首先看到的就是叶修上下颠动的脚。 两个声音他都很熟悉，一个是他的叶小队长，一个是嘉世最大的赞助商。陶轩先愣了一下，然后马上关严了房门，快步走进去。 这下子刘总和叶修都看见他了。然而刘总的结还卡着，两人正紧紧的连在一起，谁的动作也停不下来。刘总的胯仍然挺动着，龟头在内腔磨动、顶弄着，好像下一秒就要射出了。叶修两手绑在后面，眼神越过了陶轩，也不知在看着什么。 "啊……啊……" 叶修细微的呻吟响起来，他感觉到了身上的alpha正在他体内射精。精液一股一股地直接打在宫腔的嫩肉上，刘总挺直了脊背，把叶修死死按在自己的鸡巴上。 结慢慢消退，alpha的阴茎却还硬着。叶修身上没什么力气，整个人朝刘总身上趴过去，眼睛闭着，好像要睡着了似的。 方才的激情时刻刘总来不及说话，现在他空下来了，抱着叶修回头道："你这个omega挺不错的，下赛季的合同明天给你送去。" 这话的意思是让陶轩滚蛋了。 "我操你妈的！" 陶轩怎么说是个alpha，一点不带折扣的，听了这混账话，血气直涌到面上来。他揪着刘总的脖领子，把他从床上拉下来。 论体格，刘总跟年轻力壮的陶轩差距不小，但刘总一点不怕。虽说嘉世是新科冠军，可毕竟是联盟第一年，赞助商们都是个看热闹的观望心态，他这笔赞助费还真不是可有可无。刘总看着气喘吁吁的陶轩，嘴边甚至还挂了点笑。 陶轩心里跳得很快，那是气的。他的眼睛看着躺在弄得乱七八糟的床上的叶修，耳朵里全是自己"砰砰砰"的心跳声，他想想自己还有支队伍要养，嘉世还有很多个赛季要打。渐渐地，他脸上的愤怒的红色褪了下去，变成了一种不红不白的颜色。 刘总又道："三个赛季，这样总行了吧。" 陶轩没说行，但从他脸上的表情，刘总就知道他不会不同意。他侧了侧身子："要不一起？" *~*TEXT*~*

The only thing preventing them all from seeing Alicia with her hand down Katie's Quidditch leathers was the heavy fabric covering the stands. The thought sent Katie tumbling over the edge.

I thought I was ready to reclaim this too.”   “I understand.”  And she knew if anyone could understand, it was Fenris. *~*TEXT*~*

I thought T’Pring was beautiful the last time I saw her: her perky tanned breasts bouncing just the tiniest bit as she gyrated her hips against my fast fingers, the squeaks and squeals as I made her orgasm for the first time, consummating our new marriage. *~*TEXT*~*

"You were in Brazil for a month.  Surely  you brought me back a momento," Ginny teased. "Some token of your affection."  "You doubt my affection?" Luna asked, her head cocked quizzically to one side. "Maybe another round will help convince you."  Luna's fingers stopped drawing lazy circles and began to drift down. They slid inside Ginny's cunt, her thumb rubbing Ginny's clit with practiced ease. Ginny moaned.  This was much better than a souvenir. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Jim was ready.  The most ready he had ever been his life.  Clothes off, love stick primed and throbbing like the bass line of a country hick song.  “I’m going to ram by love machine so far up your secret velvet passage, and coat your walls with my diamond passion, you’ll be made a man all over again,” Jim purrs to Bones, sprawling like a gleaming, tight skinned, naked mole rat in the Captain’s chair. His abs positively pulse with the solidity of his masculine frame, his thighs creamier than a cream coloured courser of the phylum Chordata. Oh, his thoughts were more impure than an unrefined carbohydrate.  “No you’re not,” the doctor growls back.  And then he stabs Jim with a hypo.  “Fascinating,” Spock mutters from across the bridge as Jim collapses unconscious and slides off the chair. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Prologue  	It was one Christmas two years ago when I met Darien.  I bumped into him in the snow.  He was so polite.  A sweet boy, kind and gentle.  Everybody loved him.  But I love him the most.  And he loves me too.  We snuck glances at each other across the park, and it was so exciting to realize that our feelings were mutual.  	“Mariko.”  The way he said my name was so deep, so soothing, so warm.    But recently, he’s been distancing himself from me.  “What’s wrong, Darien?”  	Somehow, he averts his eyes.  He still cares, but something is bothering him now.  Looking at that haunted expression on his hurts me so much.  “I still love you, Mariko,” he will say, but his voice is always full of pain.  	If only there is some way I can cure that pain…  Some way I can help him…  I am such a bad girlfriend for not being able to tell what’s wrong.  I must find out.  I have to find out! *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*What were they thinking, putting Holodecks on starships with teenages.   It started innocently enough: a pleasant walk with Wesley through a virtual simulation of a sunny Earth rosegarden, a stop into a cheerful 20th-century-style diner, a chocolate shake and a soda-pop over a discussion of his recent mental health. It was fine, I suppose.   But I must say I preferred the section of our consultation in which Wesley programmed a monstrously well-equipped Klingon to fuck me in the ass on my hands and knees while he unzipped the pants of his cadet uniform and masturbated in front of my face. *~*TEXT*~*

Jim grinned as he ran his firm hand over his sub’s smooth bum skin and then rested a finger on the boy’s open asshole, fingering around the crinkly circle of the anal folds he had just finished shoving his greedy erect cock into. His fingernail brushed up against beads of glistening cum as his digit went round and round the penetrated orifice.  “What’s the matter, Pavel? Was I too big for you?” “Why, yes, sir. I vould have to say, almost half as big as Mr. Spock vas the other day.” Kirk removed his finger. *~*TEXT*~*

He threw his head back, letting the droplets of  Sweat and tears  Run down the sides of his face, his mouth  Wide open as he screamed in delight,  The wave crashing over him  As he rode it out to his heart's content. But  Conquering one wave  Was not enough for Lance, and it never would  Be.   He waited a minute for the force to build up  Again before going out to sea  Once more, and then again, and again, until  His thighs grew tired and  His hips were sore, and at that point he just let  The ocean take him  To wherever it pleased, and he did not mind it  One bit  Because he was always brought back safe  And sound  Engulfed in the waters of hazy afterglow,  Nestled in the arms of his Prince.                   *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Mirror Kira has had some fun with her counterpart from another universe... *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Is fucking your counterpart masturbation, or incest? On one hand, pleasing her is just like pleasing myself: I know she loves it when I strip her of her dull uniform, plop her down on the slick marble floor of my bubble bath, and massage her tense shoulders, her soft breasts, and her round hips, rubbing every knot out of that perfectly smooth skin, perking up those adorably shy nipples with pinches and slaps, coaxing an orgasm out of her underused clit. But her reaction is so opposite what mine would be that it makes her bizarrely different: not like a copy of me, but some long-lost sister. Because when I cup her waist in my hands, drag her towards me, and shove my fingers up her wet vagina, she’s not excited, enthralled, and aggressive; ready, desperate to fuck right then and there like I would be: she’s looking down at her feet modestly, even submissively, as if she’s scared. It just makes it all the more thrilling. *~*TEXT*~*

He loved watching his Prince brush it out for Him, the bristles parting the (rarely) tangled Mess into soft silk. Perfect for him to play with as he wished, as if he were His own little doll. But he loved Lotor’s hair the most when it was Twisted and knotted Tightly within his fists, gripping on to the only Source of reality when Lotor fucked the life out of him, and sent his Soul straight into oblivion. And then they became his rope, gently pulling Him back to his Corporeal state, the pearly white locks Becoming matted within His grasp, still entwined within his lanky Fingers when he finally Awoke. There was really no questioning it. Lance loved Lotor’s hair *~*TEXT*~*

His bite is mild, more a tickle, a scrape than any warning to be still or be quiet. He buries his nose into her silvery white pubic hair, inhaling its musk with a deep appreciation.   Isane inhales shakily, willing her squeal, her gasp to remain in her throat as he begins dragging his tongue over her clit. It proves a useless effort, though, again and again, and again. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*别看刘总是个久经风月的人，但其实酒量不怎么行，刚刚两杯酒下肚，刘总就觉得头昏眼花，叫了人扶他上楼休息了。  刚走出电梯口，他便闻见一股若有似无的信息素味儿。也许是喝过酒的缘故，刘总也没想那么多，循着味道一路摸过去，发现走廊尽头的一个房间的门并没有关严。  "哎，您的房间在那边……"  "你管我去哪间……"刘总一把甩开秘书搀着他的胳膊，推开了那扇微微透出灯光的门。  玄关处开着一盏暗暗的灯，暖黄色的灯光斜斜地照进去，屋里有一张大床，白色的被子隆起来，隐隐约约是个人在上面侧躺着。  刘总心脏狂跳，把房门合上，放缓了脚步，一手扶着墙，悄悄地走到床边。现在他很确认了，楼道里那股勾人的味道就是从这里传出去的，就是这个被子下面的omega发出的。他眯着眼睛看了一会儿，蹬掉皮鞋爬上了床。  被子下面的肉体热得惊人，在刘总的手心下轻颤着，皮肤表面沁着一层薄汗。刘总贴在这个又香又软的omega背后，粗大的阴茎隔着几层布料埋在股缝里。他就像是个赛马手似的，粗壮的大腿贴在o两腿外侧，不停地挺腰摆胯，好像隔着裤子就能把这个omega操到高潮。  "唔……别……"  听见床上的omega叫了一声，刘总觉得隐约有些熟悉，便掐着他的下巴，把他的脸蛋扭过来。借着昏暗的亮光，刘总定睛一看，一双眼睛紧紧闭着，鼻梁上有些冒出来的汗珠，嘴唇微张——正是那个嘉世的小队长！  刘总心里一惊，手底下也跟着一松，叶修喝了酒，睡得很沉，马上又倒下去睡了。  "我操……这他妈的……"  刘总一见是叶修，先想到他和陶轩之间那点关系。本来都走到门前了，结果又被信息素勾了回来。他站在床边，居高临下地俯视着床上熟睡的叶修，胯下的大棒硬得发疼。他心里合计一下，还是掀开了薄被，三两下把叶修的睡裤拉到膝弯处，把自己的大鸡巴从裤裆里放出来，擎着叶修的小手给自己打枪。  叶修的手心柔软滚烫，硕大的龟头顶在他手心里，马眼里的清液弄了他一手。刘总就喜欢这样的小孩，更喜欢他这双美手，见他在控制下温顺地抚弄着自己的阳具，刘总性欲勃发，挺着肉棒塞进叶修两腿间，鼻子顶在后颈的腺体上，情难自制地嗅着那里浓郁的信息素味儿。  "嗯……嗯……"  alpha的信息素早就起了作用。叶修本来在发情期，现在恰好撞上一个能抚慰他发情期的alpha，熟知情欲的肉体率先进入了状态。仅仅是被alpha的阳具猥亵着腿缝，叶修就已经十分难耐了。  叶修的大腿根处十分丰满，软肉夹着男人的东西，屁股也被带动着前后摇摆。粗大的鸡巴隔着层棉内裤不停地在阴部摩擦，龟头时不时地和前面的性器撞在一起。omega的身体受不了这样的淫弄，没过多久就呻吟着高潮了。  "啊呀……"  刘总双手环着叶修的小腰，胯部和叶修的屁股之间只有一层布料。他操着叶修的腿，感觉到两人之间的布料被洇湿了一大片，便知是叶修喷水了。他之前也搞过不少omega，但叶修这么反应强烈的，他也没见过几个。  出于对这个omega的好奇，刘总趴到叶修两腿之间，拨开了遮挡的一层布料。他也不管四处乱喷的淫水，两只大手叶修的臀瓣掰开，露出中间湿得一塌糊涂的肉穴。  "这骚货，水还挺多……"  看着翕张的穴口，刘总忽然感觉喉咙干得发紧，还没等他反应，嘴唇就已经贴上了粉嫩的洞口。  "啊啊……不行……"叶修好像忽然醒过来似的，浑身肌肉都绷紧了，"啊、啊……会……会喷的……"  刘总被他激烈的反应吓了一跳，还以为叶修要醒过来了，刚刚准备起身，结果肉洞里马上喷出一道水来，直直地喷进他嘴里。  "我操……"  看叶修爽得浑身乱颤，刘总也来了兴致。粗糙的舌面先是来来回回地把整个阴部舔了一遍，看到叶修浑身肌肉抽紧了，刘总怕他又潮喷，只得含住瑟缩着的洞口，用舌尖在柔软的肉环上顶弄。弄了不多时，又是一股骚水泌出来。  "陶哥……"叶修两眼还是闭着，脸上不知何时已挂了泪，"啊……我不行了……真的……"  刘总不理他，两根食指把穴口撑开，舌尖从张开的细缝里探进去。叶修被舔着穴，脸上发烫，但又爽得不行，修长的两腿合拢，把刘总的头死死地夹在两腿之间。  "你真是打电竞的？浪成这样，不会去比赛也得夹着什么东西吧。"刘总拍拍他的屁股，"骚逼，别夹腿了。换个姿势，我好用鸡巴通通你这骚穴。"  "呜……"  叶修还没醒过来，迷迷糊糊间被翻了个身。上身趴在床上，两腿跪着，好像跪乳的羔羊。刘总趴在他身上，圆润的龟头被小嘴咬着，已经陷进去一小部分。 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*This here is a dark, dark chocolate cookie of the McKirk's variety. There is a big issue to get the podfic permission from authors of this pairing and I've struck out so many times, that gracious spikeface's agreement saved my faith in this fandom singlehandedly. I've been struggling not to be enticed by this amazing story, but it'd sensually pulled me it by my bloodied entails.   Please be advised, that not only the tropes in this text can be interpreted as disturbing (it is mirror verse, after all), but also my excessive use of too quiet or too loud sound effects (again, from  SoundBible.com ).

*~*TEXT*~*    ***     Slowly Nate realized the featherlight touches trailing down his neck were not a part of his very, very pleasant dream. He smiled before he opened his eyes.   “Mmh. You’re making my dream come true,” he murmured, feeling an answering grin stretch the mouth currently pressing against his collarbone.   “I know. You talk in your sleep.”   Between his lashes, Nate caught a delightful glimpse of the light dancing in Danse’s eyes just before said mouth found his. The kiss was slow and sweet and oh so perfect, Danse’s thick hair sliding between his fingers, every dip and scar on the sleep-warm skin familiar under his hands.   The smile still tugged at Nate’s lips as Danse eventually pulled back to pick up where he had left off, brushing kisses down his breastbone.   “Good morning,” Nate breathed between the playful nips and licks, opening his legs further to make more room for whatever Danse had in mind.   “Oh, it will be,” Danse promised. He was always true to his words.   Gradually hushed words and chuckles turned into softly whispered names and long, languid groans, the sounds happily lingering within the surrounding walls. Specks of dust floated in the tranquil rays of morning sun.     ***      *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Lucifer could have had any one of his simpering ass kissing minions do this for him. They could have gotten their hands dirty - dealt with the pained moans and pathetic stitch-by-stitch begging - but something tugged at the  Morning star , just below his navel. Slowly, gently, with reverence, Lucifer continues to pierce quivering flesh and relish in the loud whimpering coming from Gabe’s now tightly sewn shut mouth. An angelic brother deserves the tender touch of another, not a stinking demon with paws too big and clumsy for the job. Lucifer ties off the knot and nods once. “All done, brother.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Written for hp_nextgen100's prompt of 'like a virgin'. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*They’ve done it plenty: Against walls (alleys, backrooms, Hogwarts hallways), in bathroom stalls (clean ones at the Leaky, dirty ones at the club), in beds (their dormitories, the Burrow, the sacrilege of home). They’ve done it on the verge of getting caught in the locker room after one of James’s games (still sweaty and dirt-smeared and huffing from exertion). Albus has sucked his brother off slow under the stands (tongue a weapon of torture) once everyone’s gone home. They’ve probably done it every conceivable place (some inconceivable).  It’s not the place that makes it different. Not which bed or wall.     It’s now. It’s this. In the not-dark-enough.  It’s James on top of him, Al’s legs clenching on his shoulders.  It’s the soundlessness, no booming club bass or the muffled noise of people approaching as they strive to finish.  It’s James’s eyes, shining in the scant light. His cock bottoming out, filling Albus up. It’s James’s hips rocking, the crush of his lean weight.  It’s the illicit exchange of breath in the dark, looking straight into each other when they come.  It’s seeing it in his brother’s eyes: reverence, destruction.  That’s what it is.  And, like that, it’s all new again. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Moments of remembering, of not being able to fight back the bile and bad dreams that come from tens of lifetimes spent at the mercy of a man whose sole purpose in this and every other life is to cause pain, discomfort, and chaos. Lucifer’s true face is a hollowed out shell of a creature that reeks of raping goodness from the world, and the worst part - the Angel wearing a Demon overcoat probably doesn’t even realise it. Sam wants to share, to maybe cleanse his soul, but something holds him back; the feel of flames licking at his toes. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~** * * Of course Shiro would be well-endowed. He was already so perfect in every other way, so it really shouldn’t be a surprise that he was impressively sized. But, for some reason, Keith was still astounded by it. Shiro was still soft, yet incredibly hefty, when Keith first pulled him out of his trousers. He tested the weight of it against his palm, tugging gently at the foreskin as he felt the flesh harden responsively in his hand. Was he really doing this for Shiro? “You okay?” Shiro asked above him, and Keith realized he had been staring dumbstruck at Shiro’s cock like a naive idiot. Keith swallowed and nodded, wrapping both hands around Shiro’s member. “Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?” Shiro closed his eyes, breath falling short. “You just seem a little… distracted.” “Well, I have wanted to see your dick since we first met.” Shiro chuckled breathily. “Y-you should have told me sooner, then.” Keith shrugged, trying to keep his composure as pre-cum started to dribble over his palms. He pumped Shiro’s cock faster. “I don’t think this is gonna fit in me.” Shiro’s eyes darted open, a little surprised. “You – you want me inside of you?” Keith smirked. * * * *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~** * *  Eren never quite knew what to think when Jean pulled down his shorts and his long horse cock revealed itself, bobbing heavily under its own weight. There was the excitement of being able to witness something so large and inviting; but there was also the daunting idea that he was meant to receive it in some fashion.  He spread himself out on his bedsheets as Jean took another languid drag from the joint, blowing smoke out towards the open window. The warm spring air was pleasant on Eren’s skin, and it helped his body relax as much as it could.  Jean turned his snapback around on his head and leaned forward, lazily stroking his hardened member. “You prep yourself?”  “Yeah,” Eren hooked his hands underneath his legs and spread his knees open, showcasing his puckered entrance for Jean. He attempted to hide his anxiety with assured cockiness. “C’mon. Let’s do it.”  Jean smirked as he carefully placed the joint on the windowsill, the pungent, herbal scent hitting Eren’s senses. Maybe the weed would make his body more pliant to receive Jean’s massive intrusion. He closed his eyes tightly when he felt the tip at his entrance. He held his breath.  * * * *~*TEXT*~*

"Hyung," he whined, traitorous hips rolling forward.  "Let me."  "Oh, fuck," Jiyong panted, heat pooling in his belly. "Please," he begged, eyes clenched shut.

*~*TEXT*~*Ryo watches as chaos reigns at Sabbath. Demons terrorize sexy drunken weirdos. Nobody’s died yet, but it’s early. Out of the corner of his eye, Ryo notices Akira start to stagger forward. “This is it!” Akira manages a few stumbling steps before collapsing on the dance floor. The sound of church bells echoes through the nightclub from somewhere. A crowd of demons and drunken buffoons turn and stare. Ryo pushes through them, desperate not to miss the moment of truth. Akira lays prone on his back, his crotch writhing violently. The sound of bells intensifies. Akira seems not so much tortured as confused and embarrassed. Suddenly the writhing stops, and something springs forth. A demonic head with a vicious mouth of fangs and twisted glowing eyes, all between two leathery wings. And all at the end of Akira’s now enormous dick. It screams like a baby Godzilla. Fin *~*TEXT*~*

He feels like he’s going to get lockjaw as it is.  But, when it comes to rimming, Dean is insatiable.  And it’s funny, because the first time Sam tried it on him, he flipped the fuck out. It’s gross, it’s unhygienic, wah, wah, wah.  After that, Sam had had to pull the puppy eyes and dimples to get him to at least let him try again.  Let’s just say, Sam has a very talented tongue.  “Oh god, Sam! Fuck…”  Needless to say, Dean LOVES it now.  Sam smiles, burying his nose in the crack of Dean’s ass and pointing his tongue, fucking into his brother with sharp, wet jabs.  Dean moans and spreads his legs wider, rutting wantonly against the mattress, his fingers so tight in the sheets Sam can hear stitches tear.  “Oh, yeah… More, Sammy… Please…”  Sam is happy to oblige. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Aro’s thighs quivered as he gasped. You grinned from your position buried under them. With another quick swipe of your tongue, Aro lost balance, grabbing the armrest behind your head caused him to push his heat deeper into your mouth. Aro moaned loudly and you would have gladly suffocated right there. With renewed passion, you worked your tongue over his most sensitive area. The view was amazing. Aro’s face was flushed, his gaze fuzzing a little as he looked down at your own blazing face.  His view must have been just as nice because only a moment later he was dripping onto your face for the third time. Aro’s breath was still rushed as he gently ran his fingers across your cheek. He shakily lifted himself up, but couldn't move very far, tremors of pleasure were still making their way down his legs. Suddenly, you remembered the observers… the realization hit that you were in for a long night as the thin blonde made his way over, gently kissing Aro’s forehead before he pushed his hand between your own legs *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*As soon as Jody is gone, Sam drags Dean upstairs. He leaves a trail of clothes in their wake and Dean’s completely bare when Sam pushes him down onto the sleeping bag.  “This seems a little off balance,” Dean complains, tugging at Sam’s clothes as his younger brother sucks hickeys down the line of his throat. “You better be plannin’ on gettin’ naked, too.”  Sam growls, nipping at Dean’s jaw, before sitting back and and practically ripping off his many layers. When his boxers finally hit the floor beside the sleeping back, Dean yanks his brother back down.  “God, Dean,” Sam almost-snarls, fitting himself between Dean’s thighs. “Almost lost you.”  “But you didn’t. So come on, little brother. Show me how alive we are.”     Fifteen minutes late, Dean finds himself with his legs held wide by Sam’s bruising grip as his brother sets up a brutal pace and he knows he’s going to to be feeling his words for the rest of the week. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Sam's hands are huge on Jack's ass, spreading him wide for the viewing pleasure of the brothers. The action somehow makes Sam's cock feel even bigger in Jack's hole than it already is. He whines, flexing his hands in Dean's grip, but he doesn't safeword. He never wants this to end. His whole body is alight with pleasure.  Dean’s knees are planted on either side of Jack’s body, thighs thick where Jack’s arms are looped around them. His cock leaves a slick trail between Jack’s shoulder blades, a mental image that has Jack moaning into the pillow.  “Please,” he whimpers, shifting his hips a little to try and get some friction on his cock.  “Shhh,” Dean soothes. “We’ll take care of you, sweetheart.”  And they will, Jack knows that. He also knows they’re going to take their sweet time doing it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*设定：每个人都有动物形态，兽态的时候行为和思想会比较像动物本身，自制力低下（有点像疯狂动物城+哨向设定的结合体？）。可以部分或完整化人。以动物形态生孩子，混血不会产生杂交种。老白参军年龄比较小，有点类似于上寄宿学校的感觉，不光要做体能训练还要上课考试什么的。     ——————     白家从白曜隆的太太太爷爷辈起就是纯正猫系血统，所以白爷爷一点也不惊讶白妈妈生出了一只白虎崽子，想想还有点小自豪。白家世代参军，有过不少为国立功的烈士，所以白曜隆打小就被往职业军人培养，加上身体素质好，小小年纪就有了大高个儿和一身腱子肉。白爸爸一看，很满意，但我是猫系，我不说。白爷爷一看，特别满意，但我傲娇，我不说。白妈妈天天看，又满意又心疼，但我刀子口豆腐心，我不能表露出来。     日子一天天过去了，缺少家庭温暖的（划掉）白曜隆有了一个特别不威风的小秘密：他沉迷于吸狗无法自拔。毕竟犬系的朋友们都那么热情，那么阳光，那么real！就连军区大院儿隔壁看起来特别吓人的藏獒大校刘嘉裕和灰狼上校丁飞都对他特别好，看他在院子里晒太阳都会过来抓抓他下巴，挠挠他肚子，不把他舒服到呼噜呼噜都不带撒手的。     而当刘嘉裕拉着一个人向他们这群新兵蛋子介绍说“这是你们的教官王昊，威尔士柯基。”的时候，白曜隆觉得自己的小秘密可能快要守不住了。旁边的战友们都在讨论没想到大名鼎鼎、立功无数的王昊PG One竟然是只柯基。而白曜隆脑子里只有一屏幕的“啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊”、“他的手好可爱啊！”、“不知道脚是不是也是圆圆的？”、“他的屁股一定很好摸！”、“不愧是柯基，短腿也激萌！”、“想吸兽态的万万~”、“桥度麻袋万万是什么？”、“啊啊啊不管了就是好可爱啊想吸嘤嘤嘤”…如同脱缰的草泥马般奔过，震得他心跳都要紊乱了。     王昊听着窃窃私语又伸手把帽檐压低了一点，眼神一扫定在了老刘嘱咐他要特别照顾的白曜隆上。身体素质倒是不错，就是有点白得不像刚经历完一周新兵训练的样子，而且怎么这么…红？难道是在笑我腿短？     “喂，你。对就你。”王昊一仰头，“你有什么话就直说，看你再憋下去都要熟了。”     人群的目光一下子全都落到了白曜隆身上，他一脸状况外地抬头一看，期待的小眼神犹如猎人的一颗子弹，惊得王昊心中的小鹿突然开始没日没夜做到大。“我吗？报告教官我没什么要说的！”除了您实在是太太太可爱了之外。被萌到的王昊不得不用两句调笑话带过，转身离开的时候重重地锤了两下自己的胸口，同时记住了比自家2岁的小侄子还像幼犬的白曜隆。     ——————     刚听刘嘉裕说起的时候王昊以为白曜隆又是一个被家里送来改造的纨绔红二代，没想到几个月下来这小崽子竟然在班里一直名列前茅，除了精神力都是前三，让王昊刮目相看。本来身为整个班的大领导，白曜隆的成绩在王昊看来是非常不错的了，毕竟谁没有偏科过？但扛不住基友李京泽天天搁他这念叨什么“白曜隆就差精神力不行了”，“要是能提高一点能力会有质的飞跃啊”。     李京泽是白曜隆导师，本体是一只天鹅，话唠，能说，声音还哑，常常怼得身边人怀疑人生。王昊被念得耳朵都要起茧子，只好答应去给白曜隆开个小灶。至于这白曜隆到底是面对什么情况精神力低下？李京泽笑得很缺德（划掉）神秘，手里塞给王昊一张小纸条。     ——————     精神力练习和测试都是在一个封闭的小房间里，上下左右都是屏幕，后面还藏了音响，可以非常真实的模拟各种各样的场景。学员被要求穿上最舒适的衣服，锻炼在最放松的状态面对最紧急的情况。可今天王昊不需要打开模拟器，他有个更经济节能的办法。     白曜隆被眼前的景象惊呆了。一只可爱度超过标准的柯基犬左戳戳、右戳戳了好半天才从衣服里面钻出来，头上的毛都被蹭得有点乱了。这柯基，不，王昊，一出来向白曜隆奔过来，哼哧哼哧地摇着尾巴绕着他转圈。腿短跑不快，屁股还一扭一扭的，尾巴蹭过白曜隆裸露的脚踝带来一丝麻痒，还让他抖了一下。     不出王昊所料，白曜隆开始心跳加速，呼吸急促，浑身颤抖，没多久就发出一声自暴自弃的吼声，变成了一只白虎从衣服堆里跳了出来。可王昊没想到的是，白曜隆一蹦三米高就开始追着他跑。他哪里是腿长将近1米的猎食性动物的对手，没跑两步就被白曜隆从身后抓住了。还没等王昊对自己的生存处境产生绝望，就感觉自己屁股间一股热气传来。     “白曜隆居然把他的脸塞到塞到了我的屁股里？！”王昊惊。     “啊啊啊啊啊万万的屁股爪感真的太好了！！！上面的毛怎么感觉比我脸上的毛还要软嘤嘤嘤！！”白痴汉。  --- TBC *~*TEXT*~*

She sniffled silently. “Screw this,” Rey murmured. She sniffles again before crumpling the small piece of torn paper and tosses it over her back, blindly aiming for her bag.     But instead of shooting straight right into her bag, the crumpled paper reaches someone and lands straight into his head.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Alec moaned, his fingers curling in Magnus' hair as the warlock bobbed his head up and down. He couldn't help but to thrust his hips up as he felt his release building. Magnus held still, letting the man fuck his mouth, moaning around Alec's cock.  With a shout of Magnus' name, Alec came hard, thrusting once, then twice before relaxing against the sheets, breathing heavily.  He felt kisses pressed along his stomach, then Magnus was pushing the covers off his head and smiling up at the shadowhunter. "Good?"  "Good? That was fucking amazing!" Alec replied, touching his boyfriend's cheek.  Magnus smiled again before trailing more kisses up Alec's chest until pressing a final one on his lips. "Mm, happy birthday, Alexander." He gave him another kiss before settling against the man's chest. "I love you."  "I love you too," Alec said, wrapping his arms around Magnus and holding him tight. "I know there's plans today, but all I want to do is stay in bed with you."  Magnus chuckled softly. "I'm sure everyone would understand if we're a few minutes late," He said, tracing Alec's stamina rune. *~*TEXT*~*

Look how shiny it is now.”  It was indeed very shiny.  Mulder dipped his head to lick her juices off his nameplate. She was the most delicious thing he‘d ever tasted. He looked into her big blue wet eyes.  “Scully I love you. You are my one and only. Please have the sex with me,” Mulder pled with his puppy eyes.  Scully flung herself off his desk and onto her knees, reaching for the massive rock hard bulge in his pants. Mulder moaned loudly as she sucked on the love stick she liberated from its denim prison.  “Oh Scully you are such a good girl.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Arthur finds out why he likes sex with Merlin so much *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Arthur moaned deeply. This was fantastic. He didn’t know how Merlin did it, but each time they had sex, he found ways to make him feel even better than the last time. He had never felt sensations remotely similar to what he experienced with Merlin.   The only thing that he didn’t really like was that Merlin kept his eyes screwed shut while fucking him. He had a thing for Merlin’s blue eyes and would have loved to see them while they were at it.   Tossing his head back when he felt Merlin once again deep inside him, Arthur clutched Merlin’s arms. “Merl…” The feeling was overwhelming and it was as it just intensified.   Just as he couldn’t hold back any longer and came harder than he thought he ever did, Arthur caught a glimpse of Merlin’s eyes. They had lost all of their blue and shone golden when he, too, came.   Arthur loved Merlin’s weight on him and drew lazy patterns on Merlin’s back with his fingertips, a satisfied smile on his face. Sex with Merlin was magical. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It was Tuesday the 7th of September and the boys had just arrived for their first day of sixth form. They had done their GCSE's the previous year, with Liam obviously topping them all with 11 A*s, but each of them had achieved the highest distinction in BTEC Music. That had been their favourite class, with the battle of the bands competition being the highlight of the year.   Harry and Grimmy had met at the end of exams party, as Nick went to the rival school - The Wanted Secondary School. Niall and Liam were coming closer each day to being Prom King and King and Zayn was struggling with the decision to pick Perrie or GiGi. He had sat with Perrie in GCSE French, but with GiGi in Maths class. Louis was still 'single as fuck' though, which Harry liked to remind him every day. It was hard being in love with your bandmate.      Review if you want more :)    *~*TEXT*~*

If I had known that my little guy’s cream tasted like sweetened syrup before then we could’ve skipped that argument. Besides, I don’t see him complaining about a cute girl give him a handy every day.” And indeed the highly feminine boy wasn’t uttering a word of displeasure, in fact, he was encouraging her in some moments to go faster, in others to force to him to edge just to torture himself. Of course, she ignored him about the latter, wanting to cause his little cock to give her as much of the glaze it could empty from its sack. *~*TEXT*~*

It's time to grip the condom and gently pull out, but his cock is still firm enough for a last slow thrust to savor.  He loves his wife, he adores his kids, but he believes that Frank needs him as much as they do. As much as David needs him. *~*TEXT*~*

Carmin's nook tightened around your bulge and you could feel the warmth of her slurry spraying against your stomach as you roughly pailed her. You let out a groan of your own and bucked into her hard, filling her with jade slurry as she moaned under you. All in all a good fuck you had to say, but the last of her moans planted a wicked little seed in your mind, and you grinned devilishly as you pulled free of the bronzeblood and left her to clean up the mess.  Back in your room, after a quick shower, you sat at your desk and pulled out a book from a hidden compartment. The cover was a dark jade, and covered with scribbles in black ink, as well as letters cut from a magazine spelling out "Burnbook" around a black kiss mark. You quickly opened it and sorted past all the names written into it to a fresh page, pulling out your pen as you began to write, giggling to yourself. This info might come in handy later.       Carmin Arraya:  Calls out her moirails' names when she orgasms, quadrant smearing slut! *~*TEXT*~*

Sasha will care; it’s her turn to mop in here.” Belying his protests, Otabek hefted Yuri up against the tiled wall and dragged his leopard-print pants down the curve of his ass. Yuri hummed with delight when Otabek teased two fingers between his cheeks. “Then I’ll make sure to get all the come on your apron instead. You can say it’s scone icing.” “Pretty sure that’s a health code violation,” Otabek said, his fingers sinking easily into Yuri’s stretched, wet hole. “Oh.

Stop stalling and just put it in; I want you right fucking now.” How was Otabek supposed to argue with that?   *~*TEXT*~*

"Peeyew... oh my..." Rosalina said as she had both of her hands on her farting big butt, enjoying her bassy flatulence far too much to do anything else with her hands. "Peeyew!" Misty laughed as she had her hands on her knees while making wet farts, which caused her to pee her pants as well. *~*TEXT*~*

The torture continued with her sweet little sway, making me want to jump in the hay. We finished our meal and I stole one last glance, really what are the odds I might have a chance?

Something in polished ivory, just the size you prefer.” He spread his fingers, stretching Attolia wider. “I suppose we’d have to kill the artisan after, though. That’s not gossip we can have spreading through the kingdom.”  “Remind me,” Attolia said, her voice impressively level, “why I didn’t cut out your tongue.”  Glen flashed a brilliant smile. “Gladly.” *~*TEXT*~*

More than friends.  Making out on the bed, fingertips exploring, kissing, learning new flesh.  They are eager, laughing until those mouths are occupied elsewhere, tongues teasing and taunting, wringing cries and sweat forth from their desperate bodies.  Onscreen, Janet moans.

They're in London in the supply closet of the Watcher's Council. Xander's ass bumps a stake off the shelves, and Oz laughs.  Oz sucks Xander's finger, tongue going over every callus. Calluses from Madrid, Los Angeles, Sunnydale, Toronto, and Jerusalem. Every ridge tells of a different Slayer found, of a different demon kill.  Xander's hand wraps around Oz's cock. A rhythm of airports, of four-wheel vehicles, of letting Dawn speed down the Autobahn on a Vespa on their cross-country travels. Oz tastes of red sand, incense, and sweat.  With a gasp into a hotel's starchy pillow, Oz comes. He slackens, putty against Xander's movements. Every meeting, another reunion. *~*TEXT*~*

He turns his head away and tells Wesley to bring the car.  Wesley bucks underneath him as Angel fucks him. Angel blinks his eyes and watches the fish. No, they never happened.  Wesley lays his hand on Angel's shoulder. Confident, like every general sending his troops into battle. Angel goes knowingly.  Wesley's blood tastes like desperation and his swallowed heart. Angel still keeps him. Their dueling golden eyes stare at each other. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Every throne needs to be broken in. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“Say it,” Ren says, lips grazing Hux’s jaw, his teeth almost nipping the curve. Hux is in his lap, hands planted on Ren’s clothed shoulders, using him as leverage. His own body is naked, his breath heavy, strained. Ren wraps gloved hands around his waist, pulls him down just as he thrusts his hips up again, pleased when a choked, desperate moan rips from the back of Hux’s throat.  “Say. It.”   Strands of Hux’s hair have fallen loose, the dark ginger plastered to his forehead with sweat. Ren reaches out, brushes it away, pulls Hux’s head back so their eyes are locked. Hux’s lips part, the words  Supreme Leader  falling from his mouth in a quiet whisper. They make something bubble inside Ren; something like pride, fulfilment, accomplishment. He leans forward in his throne, captures Hux’s mouth in a greedy, violent kiss, and Hux repeats the title against his mouth, again and again and again. Ren groans, lets his forehead drop forward, lets it press to Hux’s shoulder, his grip of Hux’s body tightening to something painful.  As he works toward his release, Hux moving in a steady rhythm above him, Ren can’t think of a better way to rule. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*   *  That's one thing Mila loves about her — Sara's hands.  Right now they're cased with chunky, white-gold rings that are fake, just like the the delicate, metallic butterfly clasped in a white-gold spiral to Sara's upper, left arm.  Mila remembers her mentioning Sara's dance recital in a couple of hours, which explains the glimmery, ornate dress and the ivory layers of tulle crinkling and gathering up Sara's legs.  She's  beautiful , masquerading as a enchanting, spring nymph, and undulates her lower body aimed towards Mila's laptop camera. Sara has tugged off her panties and her hose, with a loveable wink, going completely nude under the flowery, handsewn costume-dress.  Sara's vaginal lips gleam-wet and clench against the rainbow-colored sex toy, vibrating inside her. Mila watches her with stunned, hungry awe as the other woman lifts her hips, moaning.  Oh, she  loves  her.  *    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Jack’s lips are soft against Sam’s, a welcome distraction from the heat of Dean’s mouth on his cock. If he lets himself focus on that, this is going to be over far too soon.  “Such a good boy,” Sam coos, letting his thumb rub gently against the boy’s cheekbone when Jack moves down to his nipples. “You’re learning fast.”  Jack blushes, taking one hard peak between his teeth and drawing a groan from Sam’s chest. He grabs at soft blonde hair and yanks Jack’s head up into another kiss.  “I want you to open Dean up for me,” Sam tells him, feeling Dean’s moan against the base of his cock.  Jack whines. “But, I wanna-”  “You’ll get it, too,” Sam promises him. “Be good for me.”  Jack nods. Later, when he’s full of Sam’s cock with his own buried in Dean’s tight heat, he decides he’s not going to question Sam’s orders again anytime soon. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*She's totally naked in front of him, and he doesn't think she's ever looked fiercer.   He pulls on Eleanor's hair, bringing her closer to his lap. Michael’s head tips back with a groan as Eleanor’s throat convulses around his dick.  She pushes against his still-clothed thighs, and he reluctantly releases her. She pulls off him with a wet sound and wipes her mouth off with the back of her hand.  If looks could kill…  “I told you not to forking do that.”  He puts his hands up in mock surrender.  “It was the heat of the moment. It won’t happen again,” Michael says.  “I’ll bite it off,” Eleanor warns, wrapping her hand around the base of him.  He smirks as she puts her lips on him again.  The thing was,  he believed her.   Michael smirks and moans low in his throat as he comes in her mouth.  Limbs loose and feeling supremely satisfied, he lifts a hand.  Snap! *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Rana ran her hand down the smooth plain of Kate’s stomach. She could feel the throb between her legs. She ached to put her own hand down there to stop it but she knew this moment was about Kate.   Moans from above broke her out of her stupor. “If you don’t fuck me soon I’m going to die”, was all that Kate could vocalize.   Entranced with the wetness Rana traced a single finger through the wetness and brought the digit up to her mouth. It was different than she expected, a certain tang and not at all unpleasant.   With the taste discovered, she went down and started kissing around Kate’s clit. She couldn’t get enough. With the place to themselves she wanted to make Kate scream.   Two fingers daring to press forward, Rana fucked Kate until her muscles ached and Kate arched off the bed.   I never knew it could be like this was all Rana though when it was all over and she was lying beside her knackered and bliss filled lover. *~*TEXT*~*

The two of you had been dating for 58 and a half minutes. His fingers, cold and metallic as they were, felt  good  inside of you. Every little stroke, every movement... it was as almost as much fun as shooting heroin into your cheekbones. Suddenly, as K1-B0 furrowed deeper inside you, something strange occurred. You looked up at him, and his eyes were wide with unruly terror. "I... I may have forgotten to mention," K1-B0 said, "my fingers, they-" *BANG* Excruciating pain shot through you, as blood poured out of your vagina. You screeched and howled in pain as K1-B0 withdrew from you, screaming along with you. "They have guns!" Perhaps physical intimacy would have to wait. *~*TEXT*~*

Jimin sort of wishes that he had a small dick it would make things a lot less complicated for him. If he could fit the stereotype maybe then his band wouldn’t be scared of his massive cock. It was all fun and games until they saw it. Now not even Taehyung, his best friend, can look at him the same way. It’s awful. Jimin cries himself to sleep every night cause no one takes the time to appreciate his personality beyond big dick. But Jiho does.  Jiho did on that fateful night in the hot tub when he stroked Jimin’s massive member and whispered sweet sweet nothings to him. Tears filled his eyes blurring the city skyline as he writhed under Jiho’s loving touch, his whimpers echoed on the marble tiles, filling the space. Jimin cried into Jiho’s shoulder as he came. One of the many bottles of empty champagne floating in the tub bumped against his naked torso as Jiho gently held him, and repeatedly affirmed Jimin’s worth.  No one else appreciates Jimin’s massive cock.  But Jiho does. *~*TEXT*~*

Admiring the sight of her girlfriend straddling a nude and dazed redhead. “Hiya Red, who’s your new pal?”  Placing her hand gently against Natasha’s chest, Ivy turned her head, a smirk as she used her free hand to beckon Harley closer. “This is Natasha.”  Making her way over, Harley smirked as she strolled around the pair then came to a stop behind Ivy, bending down as she whispered in her ear. “Oh, she’s a cutie.”  Trailing her fingers around Natasha’s breasts, Ivy hummed. “A horny cutie, aren’t you Natasha?” Natasha nodded quickly, poking her tongue between her plump lips as she mewled. “Very.”  A click of her fingers, Ivy got to her feet with Natasha kneeling before her. “Well now that Harley is here, we can begin.” *~*TEXT*~*

As she reached down to pick it up, she heard a low growl coming from behind her. Startled, Chrissy bolted upright and looked behind her.  "Oh, Bon," she said with her hand over her heart, "It's just you! Ha ha! You gave me quite the scare."  "Did I?" he asked with his hand over his crotch. "Didn't mean to scare you, sweetheart."  He smiled at her. "Oh, um... are you okay?" she asked.  "Oh, no, I'm fine."  "Oh, okay then. See ya later I guess. Bye, Bon."  "Bye bye, Chrissy."  Chrissy turned around and headed out of the room. Bon watched as Chrissy's ass and hips swayed. Licking his lips, his hand reached down to his crotch once more. After she was gone, he sighed.  "Baby, your ass is mine." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Walt's obsessed. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*You’ve taken to watching him smoke his cigarettes, just to observe the various, fascinating shapes his lips make as he takes a draw and blows out lazy grey rings. When he talks to you, you find your eyes drifting downwards and your mind drifting away, imagining very different (and very naughty) words coming from them.  You catch yourself wondering, more and more, how those lips would feel pressed against yours in a passionate kiss, or nuzzling at your neck; or making their way slowly across your chest, taking each nipple in turn as you gently caress his hair.  In your wildest and most private fantasies, they're wrapped around your cock, flushed and pink and vying with his pretty eyes for your attention as he takes you to the point of no return. Or else they’re parted on a moan as you thrust deep inside him; every time, you imagine him taking your fingers between them one by one and sucking them as he comes.   Sometimes, in the most intimate and sweetest of all these fantasies, he says your name, low and soft against your ear, and then utters the words you hope most of all to hear:  I love you.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He asks, “How did it go?” I draw him near to hide my face.  “Sam.” Lips on his neck. He draws breath.  “Sam. I told you it might … be hard.” I huff, half a laugh. He wasn’t wrong.  “Shouldn’t we talk about this? You listened after I spoke with Anne and the boys.”  Again, a true statement. True blue Joe. He had talked most of an evening. Then made love to me. Then, towards morning, wept. I couldn’t claim I’d had no warning.  I stroke his cheek. Not his smooth human forehead.  I finally speak. “Joe. Please. We’re  here  now.”  ===== He gives in, leaves me my silence on the subject of my husband, my marriage. I close Naomi’s door, then lead him into my room. We are both parents; we know how to be quiet.  He is a tender lover, and tonight is for me. Joe Carey pays his debts.  He is deep inside me, we are brow to brow, joined there and everywhere, when I shatter. I muffle my sobs poorly with my fist, elbow wrapped tight behind his neck. He pulls out, draws me into his lap, cradles and rocks me.  “I’m not him. But ... I’m here.”  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*「蒙迭戈。」 *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*「蒙迭戈。」  那個男人貼在你耳邊低聲說道。  你的耳朵便發熱起來，接著是你的脖子，你的身體。  你跟著男人走進一個空房間，窗簾閉著，室內一片昏暗。  他將門鎖上了，一步步走向你。  你早已情動，渴望地舔著嘴唇，待他靠近，跪下來解開了他的拉鍊。  他亦迫不及待，你才將他舔硬，便把你拉起來按在牆上，拉下你的褲子。  你的下身立刻暴露在空氣裡，暴露在他的注視下。你能感覺到他黏稠的目光，好像舌頭一樣舔舐著你赤裸的臀尖。  接著他掰開你的臀瓣，開始品嚐你。你在他的唇舌下恬不知恥地淫叫，扭動著屁股讓淫水糊滿他的臉，他的鬍茬也刺得你越來越想要。最終你忍不住了，放浪地哭叫，求他不要再這樣溫柔。  於是你舔過的那根大傢伙進入了你被舔開的小嘴，熟悉的飽脹感讓你幾乎同時便高潮了，滾燙的內壁把他纏得更緊，他掌摑你的屁股，咒罵你的淫蕩。  那又怎麼樣呢？還不是會在你的身體裡射出邪惡的種子來。  他擺動胯部操你，把你狠狠釘在他的陰莖上；反覆被入侵的感覺又甜蜜又充實，他還抓住你的兩團胸肉，粗糙的指尖揉捻腫大的奶頭，他徹底將你掌控住了，此刻你就徹底成了他的，你只能聽他擺佈。  濃精打進你的身體裡，打在你敏感的腸道上，你被燙得哆嗦著尿髒了牆壁，就像標記領地的小狗。  男人從高潮餘韻中恢復，輕柔地清理你的身體，讚嘆你的緊緻與美妙，期望下次能再與你共度這樣快樂的時光。  你分開腿，收縮穴口，讓他看著他的精液從那個微微合攏的小口流出，他著迷地伸手去挖弄，動作放得過慢了，開始與清理毫無關係。  你有些惱了，不顧那些液體淌到自己腿根，自己整理了著裝就要離開。反正你不缺幫你做這件事的玩伴。  他還想挽留你，想與你溫存。你早已將他拋在身後。     你十七歲那年參加一部電影的拍攝，有一場戲你怎麼也進入不了狀態。  那是你向戲中的父親哭訴的片段，他一直耐心地等待你，可大家越是寬容，你就越是緊張急迫，也越是擠不出眼淚。  導演決定跳過，讓你到一旁去休息，今天的工作告一段落之後，他叫你：「蒙迭戈！」  那是你在電影中的名字。  你跟著他到了他的房間去。  他教導了你，也懲罰了你，他的手肆意撫摸你尚且幼嫩的身體，把你撩撥得渾身發熱；他命令你在他面前自慰，你便乖乖地張開腿，兩根手指撐開自己的後穴，揉著穴口吞進一根手指。  他以為是他將你帶入成年人的世界，殊不知你早已跟兄長及弟弟玩過了無數次這種遊戲。  蒙迭戈。  他總是用你的角色名字稱呼你，於是你也將他當成你的爹地，親暱地蹭他的下身。  蒙迭戈，乖孩子，你會學會的，對不對？  你啜泣著點頭，他親吻你，猙獰的陰莖將你釘在床上。     從那部電影之後，這個詞就成了你生命的一部分。  那是使用你的憑據，進入你身體的通行證。  男人們交換著這個訊息，對你說出這個詞，你便開恩讓他們一親芳澤。  他們是那樣癡迷你，從你仍是顆青澀果實的時候，到你已然成熟的現在。  那部電影的殺青之夜，你又被一聲「蒙迭戈」呼喚，離開派對來到二樓的一個房間。  許多人在那等著你。  他們叫著你的名字，戲裡的或是戲外的，你一一應允，羞澀地脫下衣服向他們展示你的身體。  那個夜晚，你像香檳一樣被開啟，被品嚐，再射出白濁的液體。他們捧你在手心，呵護你又凌辱你，揉捏你少女一樣的乳肉，啃咬你粉嫩小巧的乳尖，掌摑你挺翹的小屁股，鑽舔你淫蕩的小穴，你在男性軀體的簇擁下綻放，被染上他們的氣息，你數不清到底吞了多少根老二，到了後來，甚至慶功宴上的男賓也加入這個遊戲，對你說出那個名字，你便乖巧地分開臀瓣允許他們進入你。  狂歡持續到深夜，你被無數次填滿，又疲憊又餮足，他們把你擦洗乾淨，為你穿回禮服，你又變回了那個單純懵懂的新人演員。  只有你，只有知曉那個單詞的那些人知道，你得體的西服下，是怎樣美妙的身體。只要說出那個詞，就能佔有你。     你離開那個房間，驅車回家，房門半掩，你知道有人在等你。  「亨利。」  他沒有以暗號稱呼你，因為他享用你不需要任何理由。他來見你，也不是為了你的身體。  「過來，我的孩子。」  你走過去，棲息在他懷裡，彷彿鯉魚回到竹籃。  「爹地。」  他輕輕撫摸你，不帶任何慾念。這就是你的歸宿了。  END *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"Listen, man. He's dead."  It had been over two decades, maybe three ever since Sid died. He had died too young, but he had a criminal record.  "He killed his own girlfriend."  Johnny could imagine it. The blood on Sid's clothes, the blood on her clothes. A weak hand, pale legs and knees, and deceased eyes that were hollow. Her pupils would be barren fields, the darkness piercing the back of her dysfunctional brain.  "He deserved to die."  No. No, he fucking didn't. He fucking did not, you cunt bag. Sid did not deserve to die. It may be criminal, but to die like that? It was a shame! He was a part of-  "It doesn't matter that he was a part of our band. He deserved to die."  Johnny sighed. All these words came back to him from a week after Sid's funeral. He was in still in mourning.  He still is.  And he can imagine Sid, rocking out with his dead girlfriend in a coffin in Hell. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Dearest Candiru,I await in agony as I keep my legs spread apart, holding back honey colored liquid among the cozy pouch inside me. The desperation drives my body and mind into a tremor, clawed toes curl and pierce the bottom of its flesh, metallic crimson liquid drifting into a pool, soon followed by the hot nector from my bladder, it shots, squirts and runs down to mix with crimson, my utheral opening begging for you to enter up the stream that flows between my scaley legs. I moan like the host, prey if you will to call me as you enter my piss hole with your smooth, slimey body. You shall clamp your sticker like pectoral fins into the flesh of my uthera, tearing and shearing at the fleshy walls. It causes delusion pain in me as you enter through my balloon like sack, using your spur like fins to scramble along the walls of its inside. I cry and moan your nick name. *~*TEXT*~*

He immediately fell in love.   “Billy, dick me down.” Steve quickly uttered, staring up at the taller man, even though Billy is actually an inch shorter than Steve. But whatever the fanfiction says.   Billy looked down shamefully. “My dad beats me.” he admitted, looking down at all the prominent bruises on his beautiful tanned skin. Steve gasped.   “Let’s have sad sex because that’s realistic.” Steve insisted, poking his bruise.   “Owie.” Billy sobbed, falling to his knees. He screamed in pain. Steve looked down at Billy in confusion.   “Sorry.” he quickly apologised. “Hey, remember when you beat me up? It’s been two days and now we’re in love. Okay?”   Billy nodded. “Fuck character development. I’m suddenly a sinless saint and will immediately open up to you.”   “Sucketh upon thy left nut, Billbert.” Steve winked.

*~*TEXT*~*Joan was everywhere. Vera smelled her coconut-scented shampoo. She heard her breathing. She felt her hands all over her nude skin. Joan’s palms were soft - surprisingly soft. Why were they so soft? How come they weren't roughened like her own? She realised it didn't matter once two digits entered her and others brushed across her centre. It didn't matter at all. Dear Lord up above, it felt amazing. Vera was unsure she had ever felt like this before. It was all-encompassing. It was magnificent. It was Joan. Soft lips - again, so remarkably soft - closed around her nipple and she thought she either was going to die from pleasure or she had already arrived in heaven. Vera heard a choked uttering of: “Don't stop.” She wouldn't realise it had been her own voice until hours later. Joan was pulling moans and cries out of her she didn't know she was capable of producing.  She was so close to her grand finale. So close to her climax...so close... *~*TEXT*~*

Yoshiko loved the sound of clattering chains, a prelude to such sin; their ravenous desires were newfound; Riko, especially, felt hot.  Riko resisted for show. Yoshiko's fingers were down there. At her vulva.  Yoshiko prodded, rubbed her clit: softly, for Riko's virginity's sake.  Riko ground, squelched, and released moans Yoshiko's lips snuffed. Yoshiko milked her of sin like a datenshi should until Riko sprayed. Only one finger touched her. She took one minute.   Yoshiko cleaned her hand and freed her. For now. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*You woke up naked, strapped to a metal table. You knew he was here. You could smell his aftershave. His cologne. His own personal musk. You knew him well. You were in love with him, after all.  But lately he had been different, distant. Almost cold. You heard him chuckle and you shivered, but it wasn't from the chill in the room. It was from the realization... There was no love in that voice. You were nothing to him.  "You awake, baby?" He said. His voice was quiet but not gentle. Tears came unbidden, slipped down your temples and trickled into your ears. You betrayed your consciousness with a shuddering breath. His icy chuckle wafted over your skin again.  And then you saw it. His arm. His hand. His blade. It was sharp and it gleamed in the light. His mouth was on your ear. "I am going to cut your heart out, baby. But we'll save that for last."  And three days later, after begging for death until your voice was gone...  He mercifully cut out your heart. *~*TEXT*~*

"If I waited for you to knock, I'd be waiting till Christmas.  Get in here!"  I'm dragged inside and before the door closes he slams me against the wall.   Nervously I laugh and ask, "Is that your sidearm, or...."  Growling, he rips my shirt apart as he grinds against me. Guess things are going well...    Fin. *~*TEXT*~*

Without warning his grip tightened around her waist and shoulders as he bucked up into her, bringing his climax pretty quickly, but she wasn’t far behind as he twitched inside of her. *~*TEXT*~*

He offers up a travel-size tube of lubrication from his pocket and TOP snatches it, Jin’s pants hanging off one leg as TOP roughly preps him and then fucks him, his grunts vibrating Jin’s body like a throbbing subwoofer to which Jin soon moans a melody. He loves coming out on top. *~*TEXT*~*

She writhed and moaned into every touch, every lick, her muscular thigh firmly against Dani's groin, letting the woman grind toward her own pleasure.  Together, they rejected the pain and crippling misery, turned their back on the darker path.  Together, they kept the light alive and strong. *~*TEXT*~*

"Anything you ask," he said, then sucked hard upon it.  James groaned, twitching under him. "Please, Steenie - "  Buckingham looked up, his wide eyes the very picture of innocence.  James slipped one hand around to the back of Buckingham's head. "Please - would you - "  Buckingham nodded, mouth bobbing on his king's cock.  With a groan, James thrust deep into his throat, feeling the hot muscles clutch at him.  Below him, Buckingham smiled wickedly. *~*TEXT*~*

Khadgar blushed, sliding his hand up and down that huge shaft, watching the way the skin moved. "You might even be big enough to - "  "To what?" asked Durotan, licking his lips.  "Let me try something," muttered Khadgar. He pressed the tip of his own hard cock against Durotan's, and then began to gently but rhythmically tug at the orc's foreskin.  Durotan grunted - but it was in pleasure, not pain. His sensitive skin had never been asked to do this before, but slowly, marvelously, it began to stretch, and slip over Khadgar's cock.  "Always wanted to try this," said Khadgar, eyes bright, as he encouraged that skin to envelop his head.  "I have never heard of it before," said Durotan, staring at where their cocks met. It was a strange but wonderful heat.  Khadgar laughed. "I'm a scholar of many things."  "You fascinate me, human," Durotan said affectionately.  "Trust me," Khadgar said, holding the foreskin in its new position. "It gets more interesting."   Durotan moaned as Khadgar started to pump at his shaft. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Mako was a lucky man. There was only one thing he wanted to see his boyfriend do. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Mako knots his fingers into the thin, blonde hair before him. He lets out a quiet and throaty hum at the feeling of Jamison’s throat contracting around the head of his dick. The older man did not often think about how lucky he was but now, with Jamison letting out small gagging noises as he chokes on the dick in his mouth, it’s all he can think of.  His breathing is ragged as he pushes his member further into the younger man’s mouth. He knew that Jamie could not take him to the base. It was not possible but that did not stop Mako from trying to shove as much into the tight heat of his lover’s mouth. As he comes, he can feel that throat tighten as his lover chokes on his come.  At that moment, he realizes the only thing that could make this better. He pulls his dick from the skinny blonde’s mouth and clamps a hand over his lips to keep him from spitting it out like he normally would. A small smirk plays on his lips as he watches his boyfriend try and shove the hand away.  “Swallow.” *~*TEXT*~*

Ron pushes a few more times and he's spilling come inside Draco's arse and then collapsing on top of the blond.  He doesn't want to move for ages, but Draco has other plans.  Draco reaches for the champagne flute.  "Happy anniversary, Weasley." *~*TEXT*~*

"We will see," she said, and started to push.  Already stretched painfully wide around those fingers, at first Taria felt nothing but pressure. Then, as her entrance was forced open a fraction more, she let out a high-pitched whine.  Garona did not stop, though they locked eyes. Taria nodded.  The stretch continued: a deep agony, yet strangely beautiful. Taria forced herself to breathe.  It was not done yet. She was already so full, so open, letting Garona inside her like none had ever been - but it was not done yet. The tight muscles were screaming as they were pushed to their limit, beyond that, and beyond  that .  Light, she wanted this, she really wanted this, but it hurt so much. But it was good too, though it was so intense, and there was still more to go, still more -  Maybe Garona was right -  Maybe it was too much -  Taria almost cried as Garona's hand slipped inside her.  "I - I told you I could," she gasped, and pleasure tumbled over her. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Vaughn loves Scooter's laugh. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*In their home, Scooter was in the kitchen making dinner and talking with Vaughn. Vaughn joked, his stomach knotted, hoping and waiting. When Scooter finally laughed fully, Vaughn’s stomach swirled delightfully. He loved Scooter’s laugh. It was loud and infectious and pure. He was always so joyful and it  really  hit home with Vaughn.  He found himself always joking and always trying to make that man laugh. If he got to hear those wonderful giggles or that cute little snort, he could die happy. Especially for the shy laughter, when Scooter’s cheeks pinked and he rubbed the back of his neck, his lips quirked in an awkward smile.  Moving from his chair, Vaughn walked across the kitchen and pulled Scooter away from his work. He wrapped an arm around Scooter’s waist, keeping him close. He pulled Scooter’s head to him with his other and kissed hard.  “Aw, shoot, Peppernip, what was that for?” he asked, giggling, his cheeks red.  Vaughn kissed down his neck. “No reason.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It’s experimental, almost—the way Lucius’ fingers drag up the underside of his cock, his touch too light to be anything other than a tease. He’s experienced, definitely, but not accustomed to the way Severus reacts; to his body.  He stares at Severus, gauges his reaction to every new motion, every new pull or rub; smirks at the quiet, stifled sounds that fall from Severus’ mouth—like he’s embarrassed, almost, to be reduced to this.       When he comes—head thrown back, eyes squeezed shut, mouth forcefully held shut—Lucius smiles, leans down to kiss him. “Told you you’d like it.” *~*TEXT*~*

Castiel shivered a nod knowing Dean would take good care of him. Knowing Dean would make sure that Cas was exactly comfortable before the teasing began.   Expertly Dean sucks, jerks and tongues Cas' cock until he is hard as a diamond. Allowing it all to Increase to overwhelming levels. Chuckling as Castiel trembles and whimpers loudly. Anxiously pleading for Dean to slow down and touch him gently. To kiss him lovingly.   But Dean continues to toy with Cas' cock and when he knows Castiel is at the edge of his 'peak' Dean finally stops.   Stepping back gradually in order to see his obedient sub cum hard.   And Castiel doesn't want anything more than to be touched as he cums so he begs,       "Dean please...."     Dean smiles and steps forward to oblige Cas.  *~*TEXT*~*

Later Kevin's going to fuck him and he already knows it's going to be perfect, just like it was this morning and yesterday and the day before and most weekends for about a decade of his life. Kevin would know the years for sure. He brushes his hand over the spiky ends of Kevin's hair and his palm lights up, hungry for more. He does it again, shivering, skin crawling, and has to rub his palm on his sweatshirt.  Scratching just makes the itch worse,  his mother used to say. He doesn't know how it could be worse.  He suspects he's going to find out. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The sight that greets him as he walks into his quarters prevents John from taking another breath. He walks further into the room, unable to tear his gaze away as Rodney slides two fingers into his mouth, sucking on them before he drags them down his body, leaving a glistening trail.  "John..."  The name is a plea as McKay curls his fingers around his hard cock and slowly starts jacking himself.  The moan that escapes from Rodney's lips snaps Sheppard out of his reverie and clothes hit the floor with each step John takes, until finally he's naked and next to the bed.  Rodney looks up and meets John's eyes, holding out his free hand.  Smiling, John wraps his fingers around Rodney's and lets himself be pulled on to the bed. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*He stood in the conservatory shivering, barefoot and naked in the morning air.             Slowly, he pulled himself up to peep over the edge of the bed. Vince was an indistinct lump, mostly covered by an eruption of bedding and pillows. There was dark blood all over the place… Vince was going to be so pissed when he came round and saw the state they were in… Christ.          ‘Bucket, water, stove,’ Bodie said, pointing, keeping the instructions simple enough for even Doyle’s addled brain. ‘Be back in a minute.’ It was closer to twenty when Bodie reappeared– the chickens had put up a good fight. He was grinning like the mad bugger he was and holding a limp hen in each hand.           They’d argued briefly about the name – Paul Smith seemed sadly trite – and sent him on his way as Paul Honey.                 *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Rodney groans as John's cock slides into him, the deep aching throb of need that runs through him finally starting to subside. Fingers run over his right thigh as his body shifts to accommodate the invader.  "Move."  But John ignores the demand and stays still, the hard cock pulsing inside Rodney and the fingertips dancing over his flesh the only indication that he isn't being impaled by a statue.  Rodney tries to shift back, tries to force John to move, but the fingers clamp down on his thigh, squeezing a warning. Dropping his head to the pillow Rodney closes his eyes, the thrum of John's cock a counterbalance to the rushing in his ears.  "John, please. I need..." Anything. Everything.  You .  After long moments John finally,  finally , moves. And with each thrust into his body, Rodney lets himself fall. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The sound of flesh on flesh rang through the room, Rodney's groan echoing into the air as John's hardness slid into him.  "Oh jesus, John..."  The gasp was swallowed by Sheppard's lips over his.  "I want-" John trembled with the effort of holding back.  "Anything, everything."  John took those words to heart and slammed into Rodney's body. Each thrust into Rodney battering his prostate and causing white flashes appearing behind his eyes.  John lowered his lips to Rodney's neck and bit.  The sharp pain a counter to the throbbing pleasure running through him, Rodney screamed and came, spilling himself between their bodies, come pooling on his stomach.  Another shout adding to the darkness, John thrust once more and stilled, emptying himself into Rodney before collapsing, cock sliding out of Rodney's ass.  Harsh, ragged breaths rend the air before the night is broken by the words neither of them have spoken before.  "I love you." *~*TEXT*~*

With the threat of the Wraith bearing down on them this was the only thing that stopped him thinking, the only thing that drove all the numbers out of Rodney's head.  He needed John; needed John to keep him grounded, to keep him sane. He was the one that they all turned to for answers; the one expected to know, to understand, to explain. And when the dead danced in his mind and the answers span just out of reach, he needed John to keep the darkness away. *~*TEXT*~*

Bonnie’s grateful for it because she’s only trying to impress Katy when in reality she knows that Katy’s the hottest girl in Letterkenny, comes in tow with being sister to the toughest guy in Letterkenny. Even if she’s wrong about being on par with Katy, she isn’t one for tearing people down so Bonnie takes solace in that and consolation in Katy’s lips brushing over her bushless piece.  Katy lifts Bonnie’s thighs and fits her face in between and her hair feels like silk and she doesn’t mind that it tickles her because if Katy’s the hottest girl in Letterkenny with her tongue against Bonnie’s clit, then she’s the  luckiest  girl in Letterkenny. *~*TEXT*~*

Draco can hear his voice—not yet showing any signs of arousal or discomfort—as he instructs the rest of the Eighth-Year DADA class on their current lesson.  Draco hadn’t asked if he could, and he half expects a hand to reach down and stop him, but it never does. Encouraged, he parts Snape’s robes, unzips his trousers, and pulls his cock free.  As his mouth closes around the head, he hears a hitch of breath. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Astoria’s back hits the wall with a thud, Pansy’s body following hers. A hand parts Astoria’s robes, hikes up her skirt, and Astoria can see the moment Pansy realises she’s got no underwear on. Her grin grows wicked, her dark eyes glittering in the low light of the corridor.  “Naughty,” she murmurs, leaning forward to capture Astoria’s mouth. She doesn’t waste any time—Pansy’s fingers press against Astoria’s cunt, the tip of her thumb pressing against Astoria’s clit, evoking moan after moan.  They’re going to get caught, Astoria thinks, but when Pansy finally slips her fingers inside, Astoria doesn’t care.   *~*TEXT*~*

She looks back at Lucius, waits to be told what she’d done wrong.  “Slower,” he says, and his gaze falls to where his wife lies on the bed. “She enjoys the build.”  They share a look—a look Astoria is yet to understand—and then Lucius’ hand is guiding her head back between Narcissa’s thighs, is ordering her to open her mouth and try again. *~*TEXT*~*

Might’ve been the fact that Tom shares that particular skill, that he’s even better at it.  It might’ve been anything, but when lips trail down her neck, when two sets of hands tease and touch and  torture , Eileen supposes it doesn’t really matter. *~*TEXT*~*

He’s prepared, his arse hovering over the leaking tip of Severus’ cock, but he won’t move, won’t sink down. Not yet.  “Draco—”  “Beg.” There’s an edge to his voice, a need, and Severus stares. Contemplates.  And then, “Please.”  It’s reluctant, tentative. Draco grins.  “More.”  Draco can see Severus swallow, can feel his grip tighten. “Please,” he says again, and again—until the word falls from his mouth like a song, until Draco finally gives him what he wants. *~*TEXT*~*

Takumi's breath hitched as he quickened his pace, all while imagining Leo's throbbing cock deep inside of him, threatening to cum hard into his fertile pussy. All he wanted to do at the end of the day is relieve all of that balled-up stress somehow. And here he was, humping a pillow while thinking of his former enemy defiling him, squealing and whimpering his name over and over. “Leo...mmmm...oh, gods...y-yes...” Takumi moaned. “Please...make me feel good...” At this point, he already lost all control, going to town on the pillow like a horny dog. “L-Leo...L-Leo...ohhh my...f-fucking...gods...yes...nnngh...h-hai...y-you're so...big...” he threw his head back and continued breathing heavily. Takumi bit his lip and ground his cunt deeper onto the pillow as he continued to moan and mewl in sheer bliss. “Mmmmmmfff...oh...L-Leo...ah~ L-Leo...nnnnn...fuck...L-Leo!!

*~*TEXT*~*Merlin stripped Arthur of his shirt, kissing him hungrily. This had become their ritual -- kissing and shoving tongues down each other’s throats over tea and scones. Every time, their tea would turn cold, neglected in favor of stroking each other’s cocks on the loveseat. Once Arthur was free of his shirt, Merlin relieved him of his own shirt, tossing it next to Arthur’s on the floor. That left them both sitting there, achingly hard, mouths hot from the kisses. Arthur was first to unbutton his trousers and expose himself for his lover, which Merlin took as instruction to do the same. They took each other’s cocks in their hands, stroking and kissing one another. Merlin released first. His seed spilled onto Arthur’s hand, which earned a deep growl. Arthur’s cock throbbed in Merlin’s hand, and when he released, he did so with a loud, unabashed moan. They cleaned and redressed one another, now that they were satisfied for the day, and before he left, Arthur made sure to kiss Merlin’s lips with a promise that he’d be back the following day for more. Merlin smiled to himself, and made sure to throw out the cold tea and scones. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*On a summer Sunday day-off, Bakugou and Todoroki decided to chill out in a very peculiar way. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Summer Sunday, rare day-off, the pro heroes Shouto Todoroki and Bakugou Katsuki, which code names was respectly “Shouto” and “Explosion”, enjoyed it at home. Exactly in Todoroki’s bedroom.  At that moment, they were in one more pleasuring intimate moment of each other.  Shouto was moaning a lot, body trembling, accelerated heartbeats and all he could think about was the pleasure received by his boyfriend’s blowjob as he came in his mouth, but…  “Shouto!”  They didn’t even notice when Todoroki’s dad, the renowned pro hero Endeavor, came back to the mansion and went to the bedroom to ask them if they needed anything. They just realized that they forgot to lock the door before when Mr. Todoroki shouted out loud his son’s name, shocked with the scene.  Shouto immediately covered his face with his hand. He felt so embarrassed that he just wanted the floor could open a hole deep enough to get in and stay there. On the other hand, shame is an unknown word for Katsuki Bakugou. Without any ceremony, Katsuki pulled off Shouto’s dick, swallowed his boyfriend’s cum, wiped the drained cum by hand, looked into Endeavor’s eyes and said to his “lovely” father-in-law.  “Eh, what’s up, doc?” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Kinktober 2017 – Day 15 – Object Insertion. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The first touch of the metal against her clit elicits a moan from Narcissa. She’s already wet—has been, for hours. Lucius had delighted in teasing and touching until she’d been reduced to this—this begging, pleading mess on their bedroom floor. He’d stretched her with his tongue; had kissed and licked and sucked until she’d all but screamed to be fucked.  She should’ve been more explicit, he’d said, when she’d glanced confusedly at the cane; but as the snake’s head slides down her slit, presses against her entrance, pushes  inside , Narcissa thinks her word choice had been just fine. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*There are others who may be able to do better, but Hound is always willing to try *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*               “I want you to do me hard,” the petite mech instructed, laying back on the threadbare blanket and fondling his already sopping valve. The maroon biolights ringing the port flickered rapidly, signaling his eagerness.                 Hound hesitated, one knee on the bed and his other hand stroking his spike to final readiness.                  “I… how hard?”                 “Dent me. I want to feel you for days…” the trick elaborated, thrusting three fingers deep inside himself and arching down onto them.                  Hound’s optics flicked to the door. “I… I’m not one that mecha request for that type of interfacing… Bracket’s actually quite good at that… maybe I should fetch him, I know he’s available… no extra charge…”                 The mech reached up his other hand and grasped Hound’s hip, tugging. “No. You. You’re so wide and strong. I want to walk out of here covered in your paint. Please. I need you. I need you inside me.”                 Hound allowed himself to be pulled onto the bed, spark contracting a little at the urgent sounds the other mech was now producing. The poor thing seemed so desperate.                  Being rough wasn’t his specialty, but he would try his best.                 That’s all he could ask of himself.       ~ End *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Hound has ways to distract himself *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*               “You have a lovely paint job; it really complements your optics,” Hound remarked, the last word emerging partially as a grunt as the dark silver mech shoved Hound’s face more firmly against the wall.                  Blunt fingers probed between Hound’s legs and he tilted his hips back to allow for better access, lubrication algorithm having already been triggered as soon as funds had been transferred to his account.                  “Shut yer trap,” the mech commanded, fingers dipping into Hound’s port. His trick let out a pleased grunt to find the walls slicked and warm. “I’m paying for  this . Not some fake compliments.”                 “Not fake at al…lll!” Hound protested, crying out as the fingers were replaced by a wide spike which thrust home, bottoming out completely. Hound dug his fingers into the cracks in the rusted metal wall and shut his optics.                  “I just really like the color gray,” he whispered, mostly to himself.                  Hound said no more words after that, only producing pre-recorded moans as he mentally conjured up wistful images of the Manganese Mountains.     ~ End *~*TEXT*~*

Van obeyed.  “Zpread hyur legz.”  Van spread his legs. “Goot. Now, relax und cloze hyur eyez.” Van grudgingly closed his eyes, jerking a little when Ivo placed a hand on his thigh. “Eazy, keed, eazy.” The hand moved up his thigh, slowly rubbing circles till it got to his groin where it stopped and was joined by Ivo’s other hand. Gently they squeezed and caressed him through his pants, Van gasping and arching his back. One hand stayed touching him while the other moved up to his fly, unbuttoning it and reaching in to stroke him. Soon he was rock hard, his breath coming in short gasps as Ivo brought him to his end, pulling him onto his lap as Van’s hot cum coated his hand.  Cleaned up and cradled like a child, Van dozed with his head against Ivo’s chest, the monster gently peppering him with kisses as Van clung to his neck. *~*TEXT*~*

His breath was as thick as his cock while you jerked him off slowly, your hands coated with warm lube.  “Please.” He moaned, soft and submissive. “Y/N, please…”  “Hold it.” You squeezed his base, using your thumb to caress the reddish head.  Castiel groaned, biting his lip hard.  “Please, please…” He squeezed his eyes shut.  “Please, what?” You used your hand to hold his chin and he just panted, “Look at me, Castiel. Please, what?”  The angel opened his eyes to you, his dilated pupils making you lick your lips.  “Please, stop so I won’t cum.”  You stopped, moving your hand away and giving him a moment to breathe, and Castiel rested his head on the headboard behind him.  “Thank you.” He whispered and you looked down to see his cock twitching and bobbing.  “Good boy.” You whispered, looking back at his face before laying your hand on his shaft again, slowly starting to stroke him again.  “Fuck.” He exclaimed, jumping.  That would be a long night. *~*TEXT*~*

Spencer’s hand was reaching up under the slinky little silk negligee he was wearing to grope his nipples. Each thrust of Spencer’s hips moved his hand around, brushing against Brendon’s sensitive nipples.  Brendon’s panties were pulled to the side so Spencer could fuck him.  They were a pretty pink pair, with a little bow on the front. They matched the camisole Brendon was wearing too. The whole set made him look adorable, fragile, and in Spencer’s opinion, irresistibly sexy. Spencer loved it. The hand he didn’t have shoved under Brendon’s top was on his hip, pulling the panties out of the way. Brendon loved the feeling of Spencer gripping his hip. His cock was throbbing in his panties with each thrust Spencer made that pounded right against his sensitive prostate. He hoped Spence wasn’t stretching his panties out too much. They were such a cute pair.   “Fuck me, Spencer, fuck!” Brendon whined.   Spencer leaned in and kissed Brendon’s neck softly.   “So sweet,” he murmured. *~*TEXT*~*

Fingers curl around the bone of his hip, and Snape stifles a moan at the slide of a cock across his entrance—thick and hard and leaking. A chin presses against his back, warm lips pressing a kiss between his shoulder blades as Malfoy finally thrusts his hips forward. *~*TEXT*~*

He hadn’t thought it possible, but he’s glad to be proved wrong.  “Faster,” Ren urges, and Hux listens, his hand curling around the bed’s frame to steady himself. His hips move in erratic thrust, his cock sliding between Ren’s tits until he’s spilling onto Ren’s chest, his come splattering across Ren’s chin. *~*TEXT*~*

Bathwater splashes between them, the soft lavender scent wafting up and invading Lily’s nostrils. It only adds to her arousal.  Narcissa kisses her mouth, down to her neck, her collarbone. She trails her hands up over Lily’s inner thigh, two fingers pressing against the wet entrance, and when the pad of a thumb swipes across her clit, Lily cries out in pleasure.    She supposes it isn’t  so  bad that Narcissa keeps showing up in the Prefect’s bathroom. *~*TEXT*~*

Rae kisses him, bringing her hand down to his so he'll start moving it again. He's still amazing with his hands and she clenches round his fingers as he returns her kiss eagerly. They'd done a lot more earlier before her flatmates came home but she loves the way he teases, slowing to a near stop before moving his fingers again and putting pressure on her clit. As he moves his thumb slowly she whispers please and he brings his other hand up to pinch her nipple.   "You feel amazing, Rae, so beautiful."  She doesn't argue, believes every word even if it's something she'd never call herself. He's been showing her for four years how much he loves her.  Finn kisses her again and speaks softly. "Nearly came too soon earlier when I went down on you, tasting you and hearing all the noises you made. Love knowing how much you enjoy it. Love you so much."  "Love you too."  He curls his fingers a little and moves his thumb faster and faster till he has to shush her again. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*On Saturday of Wasteland Weekend '17, some new friends came to the Boltcutters' fanfic/fanart meetup with a prompt, of sorts. Apparently, the Rustorationists have a full pantheon, with two major deities: Dation (god of filth) at the top, and Clor (god of cleanliness) as a Satan/opponent figure. Our neighbors, the Dead Crows, decided to adopt Clor as their god, and a good-natured religious war had been running all weekend.   The idea was, then, to write slash fic between the two gods, deliver it anonymously to both tribes, and watch the sparks fly. "You're writers," they said, "help us! We can't do this, but you can!"   So we did. And here it is. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“Please defile me,” groaned Clor, the god of cleanliness. Dation, the god of filth and dirt shrieked his joy into the howling wind.  “How can I when you’re already such a dirty, dirty god?” Dation stroked a finger down Clor’s unblemished cheek.  “Mop me harder.” Clor’s voice was rich with wanting. “Scrub all my nether regions.”  “With extra grease…”  “Elbow grease,” Clor added with a moan. “Get me all slick and dirty with your throbbing wand of filth. I want to be filled with your spirit of the dumpster.”  Dation moaned. “You would take my grey water? My filth and darkness? You would -”  “I would take it all and - I know your secret, Dation. I know your soul. I know your deepest depths. You want it. You want what only I can give you. Make me dirty,” Clor moaned into Dation’s ear, his breath hot on the god of filth’s skin.  “Yes,” Dation sighed, voice rough with wanting. “I will make you dirty and you, you -”  “I will make you clean.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Darcy was floating. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Darcy was floating, or at least it felt like it. The soft blindfold blocked out all light, leaving her in complete darkness. Her ears were covered and all she could hear was the soft   thumpswish  of her heart beat. The room was warm and she lay still on the bed, letting the world float away.  She had no sense of how long she’d been laying there, so when a hand (finally) softly caressed her face, she nearly jumped off the bed. Her heart skipped, then steadied. Another warm hand touched her knee, and after so long in nothingness it was a tether back to the world.  A tongue on her hip. A rough kiss on her palm. She lived in fragments. She had no idea who each limb belonged to, only that their touches built on each other. A  tooshort  stroke of her cunt. Soft lips on her cheek. The warm touch of a hand. Another touch, colder. Her breath seemed to echo in her head, competing with the rush of her blood. A mouth closed on her clit, and she dug her fingers into satin sheets.  *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*In which Michael shocks Gavin. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Gavin watched with an open mouthed expression of fear stuck on his face as Michael teased a small electric shock wand towards his boney hip. Michael was jerking him off quick and hard with his other hand, and Gavin was left struggling between pushing his hips up for more and shying away, terrified of the sharp shock from the wand.   Michael smiled wickedly and let the tip of the wand drop down and touch Gavin’s hip bone.  “Oh fuck!” Gavin squealed, seizing up as the electricity coursed through him.   Michael laughed, setting the wand down for a second to rub his hand soothingly over Gav’s thigh.   “You look so cute baby,” Michael said with a grin. “You’re not getting any cramps, are you?”  “No, no,” Gavin said, breathing heavily. His heart was thumping in his chest, but he still smiled giddily up at Michael. He ground his hips up towards Michael’s touch.   “Well then,” Michael said, picking up the wand again, “let’s keep going.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Sirius has a fistful of Lucius’ hair, his grip harsh when he pulls the head back. “Look at you,” he says, and his voice is a hiss—more like Lucius’ usual drawl than his own joyful one. “On your knees like a dog.”  The response is a low moan, is Lucius’ mouth dropping open, his eyes fluttering shut. Sirius chuckles—cruel, callous, condescending.  Mocking.  “Getting off on being treated like the pathetic, worthless thing you are,” he says, and he curls a hand around Lucius’ waist, palms at the aching erection. “If only your wife could see you now, hm?” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“So  wet .”  Astoria’s breath hitches at the sound of Narcissa’s voice—low and smooth. She feels herself clench around Narcissa’s fingers, feels her body shiver in anticipation.  “You’ll look so pretty once I ruin you.”  Astoria squirms, arches into the touch. Narcissa smirks, her blue eyes glittering.  “It’s what you want, isn’t it? For me to fuck you? For me to turn you out like a little whore?”  It’s  those words  coming out of  that mouth , Astoria thinks. The posh voice mixed with the best kind of obscenities. With filthy promises and delightful taunts.  She cries out, almost sobs.  “Please.”  *~*TEXT*~*

Her movements get sharper, more of a twitch than a rock, and Poe can't help smiling against her wet nipple. She gets off so fast, the first time, hard and short like a blaster bolt. She has to get rid of the pressure before they can go slow and he can spoil her, lick her open until she comes long and slow and rolling against his face. Clenching around his fingers like she wants to pull his whole hand inside her and keep him. *~*TEXT*~*

He stroked it until he felt Lance begin to tighten around him. That pale hand slid to the base and squeezed.  Lance shuddered and gripped the sheets beneath him in tight fists, eyes snapping open, “Wha-?!”  Keith smirked down at him, slowing the pump of his hips, “Payback.”  “You son of a bitch,” the blue paladin gaped up at him before groaning as Keith angled his hips to his prostate dead on,  “I hate you so fucking much right now.”   Keith chuckled breathlessly and leaned down to press a sloppy peck to his lips, fully prepared to keep this up until his boyfriend was thoroughly wrecked, “Mmm. I love it when you’re angry.” *~*TEXT*~*

Olivia gasped when he closed his lips around the piercing, sucking, then tonguing it again until she cried out. “James!”  “A clitoral piercing,” James murmured dazedly as he licked her into a second orgasm. “JAMES!” *~*TEXT*~*

Even in the late hours of the night the city was still alive, probably even more so than before. A flash crossed his eyes as BREAKING NEWS interrupted his tranquility. "New hit-man in town? or new serial killer?" The persona already new the answer. A hit-man named Poison started a group of hit-men called Murder Inc who worked for the highest bidder; yes, someone could acquire a hit-man that favored them, but overall, the gangs only loyalty was to themselves. The Persona needed a way to get information out of them to see what they were like, he wanted the ability to toy with them when they start thinking they're untouchable, wanted to see their ugly, ugly underside and hold them by the scruff of their necks for it. But first, he had to get one of them. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Her flexed muscles glistened in the moonlight that was shining on these lustful lovers, sweaty bodies pressing against one another. Soft grunts and groans fill the night air; teeth biting and grazing skin and nails digging into tissue. This was a battle for dominance and neither sides plan to lose. Siglan wrapped her legs around Falgrim’s waist, squeezing tight and using all her might to push over the dwarf and pin him to the soft grass. Her lips were red and puffy from all the attention to them, and her hands groped her own breasts and she smirked down at the dwarf who was holding herself down on his cock. “Are you ready for this jelly, baby?” Her tongue grazes her own lips before she places each hand besides Falrgrim’s head.  Before Falgrim could react to this he noticed a figure watching them from afar. He sat up with Siglan still sitting on his cock, his eyes squint as his expression turns into a disgusted one.  Stood there was the young wolf M A N in his full, a poker face plastered upon was all that could be read on his face. “Howdy ya’ll.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The door to the Falcon’s  one  onboard ’fresher had been broken for as long as Han had owned it.  After having glimpsed Han, Luke,  and  Chewbacca with their literal (or, in Chewie’s case, proverbial) pants down, Leia had learned to avert her eyes whenever she was passing in the corridor.  But now Leia needed to relieve herself, and Luke’d beaten her to it.  Leia waited outside.  Waited.  Waited some more.  Luke was taking an  awfully  long time in there!  She sighed. Checked her wrist chrono. He hadn’t even flushed yet. She sighed again.  All of a sudden, Leia heard a gasp, a moan, a sob, and finally a tortured groan coming from inside the refresher.  Oh dear. Sounded like Luke was having serious gastrointestinal difficulties. Maybe she shouldn’t be in such a rush to use the ’fresher, after all; the smell might not be—  “Leia…!”  Some of those noises were her name.  Oh no, Luke needed her! Leia burst through the ’fresher door…  …and found Luke. Masturbating. Furiously.  When he saw her staring, he blushed almost as red as the exposed, leaking tip of his erection. “Leia…!” Luke whimpered, quivering.  Oh.  Oh .  “Need some help with that?” Leia asked boldly. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Harry gasped as he thrust up into his fist, the dildo sliding in and out of his arse moving faster, plunging deeper. Stars before his eyes, a sheen of sweat across his chest, Harry shouted as thick pulses of come burst from his cock, coating his hand and stomach. Harry felt the dildo slip free but ignored it, his breath, pulse, and mind all attempting to recover. After a moment, Harry flicked his wand at the thick toy. "Sorry." "Bloody hell." Severus—a bit greasier than usual but otherwise none the worse for wear—sprawled on the bed, equally spent. *~*TEXT*~*

He can't see my smile, the one I'll wear back into my dreams, but he knows it's there, anyway. He slides closer, my warmth like a magnet that draws him to me. His ankles tangle with mine, his mouth pushes under the hair at the back of my neck with a soft kiss, and his sleepy voice reminds me, "Love you, Justin."  He says it every day now. *~*TEXT*~*

Inside, her skin is pale pink and glistens with the promise of musky saltiness.  “I hear the Tyrell family tastes of roses,” she murmurs, leaning in, “I will make do with the taste.”  Olenna snorts and bows her head forward. Her position borders on eager and demanding rather than submissive.  The drag of her tongue is slow and deliberate. This is teasing rather than excited. She savors the heady odor and taste caking her tongue.  She huffs praise. *~*TEXT*~*

But some part of Alfred knows, even as the sensation builds, that it's not going to be enough. He wraps a hand around both their cocks, and Bruce gasps, burying his face in Alfred's shoulder. "Yes, yes, touch me," hisses Bruce, but Alfred doesn't need encouraging - he's already pumping at the hard flesh trapped between their torsos. Alfred barely hears Bruce's answering moan - hardly aware of more than this, here, now, the sensation of the man he helped raise rutting against him. But he can't stop to think. "It's not enough," mutters Bruce, eyes dark and glassy. "I need more." Alfred grips harder, pumps faster. "Just come." And Bruce does, spilling over his fingers - but the madness does not abate. He's still desperate, clinging to Alfred like his life depended on it. Maybe it does. "Please, Alfred," Bruce begs, voice needy like he's never heard it before. And Alfred himself is still burning, knows this isn't going to be enough for either of them. "I'm sorry," groans Alfred, and pushes inside. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Handcuffs dig into Sam's skin, rattling the headboard on one side, the bathroom doorknob on the other, chest heaving for breath. Dean's body presses against his spine, holding him up. The grain of the cheap wood paneling scrapes against his sensitive cock every time Dean thrusts. He's gasping, little noises; moans. Sounds that could be curses, prayers in Latin, or Dean's name, trapped against the rough cloth between his lips. Straining, sweating, screaming, he comes with Dean's hand fisted in his hair, Dean's teeth in his neck. Dean comes, shuddering, Sam's muscles clenching around him, Sam's blood on his tongue. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Jiyong was white water rafting.  Except he wasn't; it was a dream.  The dream ended with him going over a waterfall, and he awoke to wet pants, his hand in a bowl of water, and Seunghyun leaning over him, leering like a feral demon.  "I hate you," Jiyong muttered groggily.  Unzipping Jiyong's black leather jeans, Seunghyun mouthed at the base of the pink-haired boy's piss-soaked cock. "I know," he mumbled shamelessly.  Throwing an arm over his face, Jiyong bit back a moan as Seungyhun took him between his lips, his erection a stark betrayal.  "Well, as long as you know." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Life comes at you fast, Christian Grey. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Christian Grey gets everything he wants at the snap of his finger. It hasn't been that way all his life - of course it hasn't - but that's the way it is now, and anything to stand between him and his goal ends up mangled in one form or another. For years, Anastasia Steele had been his goal.  She's his. She's always going to be his, or so he thinks.  He arrives home that evening to an emptiness. Anastasia usually greets him. Where is she now? Where has she gone? Maybe she's not feeling well, he thinks. Christian is, after all, an absolute demon, and sometimes she's hurt in his own crossfire.  He shrugs it off and heads upstairs. He will visit her in her bedroom.  There's no way for Christian to prepare for what he sees when he opens that door:  Sonic, balls deep in his wife. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Every chunk of flesh was fat, he decided, staring coldly into his grimacing reflection. He pinched at it, on his cheeks, his arms, thighs, neck. "Disgusting." The words left his lips in a predatory growl.  The knife he'd stolen bit down into his tightening fist, cold silver wiping away at his greasy palms. "Disgrace." The words were almost sharp as the blade, sharper, "Fat." Raising it was easier than he'd like to admit, "Ugly." Little to no pain accompanied his incision, just before his throat, just beneath his collar, "Repulsive." He watched it slide deeper and emerge, bathed in red.  Guilt weighed heavily on his shoulders. To live or not to live?  He brought the knife to his arm, below his shoulder, "Vile." The heat began first, a product of the friction from the endless chafing of steel on rubber, "Hideous." And suddenly blood was streaming down his arm, droplets escaping onto the floor, into the sink.  "Responsible,"  The words echoed off his tongue. Then Jimin collapsed. *~*TEXT*~*

A voice called, "do you know where you are?" she looked in front of me, i had no idea who she was. She put a knife on the table next to me and said, "go get em' tiger."

*~*TEXT*~*~ Realisation ~ Harry, past the point of teasing, was running on instinct, which urged him to take, to claim. Withdrawing, he thrust back in, biting back a moan as Malfoy’s muscles clung to his cock, squeezing.  Balancing himself on his arms, Harry rammed in again, watching as Malfoy arched his back, the muscles in his neck standing out in stark relief as he took Harry deep inside him. Mouth open, head flung back, he was the epitome of passion. Unable to help himself, Harry leaned down, kissing him.  Malfoy welcomed him, engulfed him, surrounded him. Harry wanted it to never end.  ~ Time slowed to a crawl as they moved. Harry felt like he was suspended in pleasure. Moving his hips, he tried to pass on some what he was feeling. From the expression on Malfoy’s face, it was working.  “ Harry ,” Draco whispered, the word barely discernible.  Something warm and all-encompassing bloomed in Harry’s chest at that. “Draco,” he breathed in reply, past all care, all worry. All he felt was overwhelming pleasure, love welling up inside him.  Harry blinked. Wait, what?  Love ? But it was too late. He started to come, the emotions inside him bursting out to pour into Draco.  ~ *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*在李达康的这短短二、三十年的人生当中，这还是他的第一次——曾经他在无人察觉的地方幻想过，但现实到底还是不一样。高育良的手指摩挲过李达康发颤的嘴唇，低下头，“第一次，你可能会不太舒服——” 李达康艰难地点点头，他伸张了手臂，握住床头的栏杆，十指舒展了再收紧，高育良微笑起来，他用一条膝盖抵住李达康大腿内侧，让他张开双腿——在他把手探下去的时候，李达康的手指动了动，似乎是想要伸过来阻止高育良。 高育良不动声色地盯住他，手上的动作却没有停顿。 李达康在他的目光下重新抓牢，咬紧了牙关——高育良抚摸着他，有节奏地缓慢律动，听见李达康从牙缝里嘶出一口气，像是呻吟的征兆，李达康自己大概也察觉到了，他脸上一下子红起来，闭上眼睛侧开头。他都不知道自己为什么这么敏感，在高育良手底下，他实在是硬得厉害。 很快，高育良完全让他裸露在外。 李达康看上去紧张而又僵硬，高育良摩挲着他的手腕，覆盖在那道蠢蠢欲动的链接上，让他放松——那股无声无息的气场再次回到他们中间，李达康好了很多，他不再那么僵硬，却依旧紧张，高育良拉过他的胳膊，绕到自己身后，李达康搂着他的后背，亲吻他的脸颊和颈侧。  高育良的手探进去。 对于李达康来说，那是他从未经历过的侵入感，他一下子绞紧了，循着痛感无意识地收缩——他越是收缩，那感觉就越明显；高育良弯曲起手指抚摸他细嫩灼热的内壁，听李达康咬紧的牙关里，忍耐不住地呻吟——忽然，李达康的呻吟声停顿了一下，等他再找回自己的呼吸，他像溺水了似的，短促急切地胸膛起伏——高育良知道自己这是找对了位置，他用了点儿力气抚摸他，李达康像是受了难，开始往上挣扎着躲他。 那道链接的前兆在他头脑深处浅浅徘徊着，他就像是一个漂泊无依的旅行者，在黑暗的大海里随波逐流，一会儿有人托着他离开水面，一会儿又被拉扯着沉下去。  “疼吗？” 李达康咬着牙不说话，只是摇摇头。 “不疼，那就别乱动。”高育良抽出手，换上他自己——可以预见的撕裂让李达康四肢并用地抱紧了高育良，高育良一下子顶进去，顶在他忍无可忍的敏感点上，从未开拓过的地方紧致而且灼热，高育良艰难地等在原地，等他那一声痛苦的吸气逐渐平缓，差不多适应了才一下一下地开始撞击。  高育良再次环握住他的手腕，那比想象中的还要精瘦有力。 灵魂伴侣的链接是双向的，李达康那么如饥似渴地想要得到它，完完全全、毫无保留地对高育良敞开着，只等高育良作为支配者的这一边展现出意愿——高育良原本以为当他打开自己这边的链接端，李达康会直接扑上来：毕竟以他们李县长那个火烧火燎的脾气，这种情况很可能会发生。然而当高育良授意他过来的时候，李达康反倒强忍着放慢了进程。 高育良有点儿惊讶地抬起头， 李达康的内心全表现在脸上——他忍耐得万分辛苦。 “达康，”高育良在他耳边轻声开口，语调里全是笑意，他抚摸着李达康的手腕，低下头，在一个不会太快又不会太慢的节奏里律动。 李达康用空闲的另一只手环抱住高育良，让两具身体贴得更近。 高育良的手从两个人中间探进去，握住李达康勃起的地方——那就像是打开了一小道关卡，厚重坚实的感情流淌出来，李达康不再压抑他自己的呻吟，而是张开嘴；高育良亲吻上去，在他们中间完成了那道连接。 *~*TEXT*~*

Needy sounds pushed their way out of his chest as he neared the edge. Peter unconsciously gripped the sheets around him harder. A loud ripping made Wade groan. Peter was so hot when he broke shit. When the pleasure overrode his brain and his ability to hold back that amazing strength.  Wade was moaning louder now, pawing at his own erection as he stared hungrily at Peter. He licked the sweat from his lips as leaned down to Peter's ear. "Oh baby boy, you look so good like this," He growled. "Cum for me, Petey." He bit hard at Peter's neck as he continued stroking him.  "Ah!" Peter gasped, arching his back as a thick rope of cum shot out.   "Nnng-" And another.   "Hnnnf!" And another. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Myranda scrubs her with force and strength suited to a scorned lover. The water is becoming cold and pearly gray, but she continues her scrubbing. Sansa grits her teeth as she focuses on the tops of her shoulders.  “You must be clean,” she grunts, bracing a hand on her shoulder, “You must be clean all over for tonight.”  Myranda drops her free hand towards her chest. Sansa presses her knees together, but refuses to whimper as she focuses on her breasts.  She digs into her nipples with quick, sharp circles. The scratch is cruel, sending unwanted tingles straight between her legs. Flush spreads over her cheeks, creeping down her neck and breasts. Erect, her nipples threaten to become raw as she scratches more and more.  She must be clean tonight. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Note from Jenna:    I will start posting my complete Sharing the Sunlight (STS) series as soon as the Archive of Our Own recognizes my registration as Jenna Sinclair.  All of my non-series work is written as Jenna Hilary Sinclair, but all of the STS series is written as Jenna Sinclair.  I've been told it will take several days for good 'ol Jenna to be valid, so in the meantime I am busy formatting the first novel.    There are three novels in the series, three novellas, and eight short stories. It's going to take a while to get through it all! I'll post everything in order starting with the first novel.  Here's the list of the entire series:  Sharing the Sunlight (novel)  Reflections on a Lunar Landscape  Pursuing Hyacinths (novella)  Heart’s Delight (novella)  Primal Scream  Parallel Courses  Double Trouble  Son of Sarek (novella)  Promises to Keep (novel)  Jagged Edges  Manna  Journey’s End  One Night  In the Shade (novel)  Hope to see you soon with more K/S! *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"Please, Arthur," gasped Eames, thrusting even as he begged, sweat plastering his hair to his forehead. "Please!" Arthur smirked, dimples showing as he rode Eames' cock, hips angled to maximize his own pleasure. He looked down at his Eames, bound and desperate, and shook his head. "Not yet, I'm not done with you." Eames groaned and shut his eyes for just a moment, but he never could resist watching when Arthur was on top. Arthur made a show of it, arching and throwing his head back, running his hands over his body and Eames' as well, tweaking nipples and caressing sensitive hipbones. He finally took his own cock in hand and stroked, feeling Eames tremble beneath him with desperation. "You'd better wait for me, Mr. Eames," said Arthur warningly, eyes flashing. "Please, can, can I come with you? Please!" Eames' words were barely coherent amidst his whimpers and moans, but Arthur did so love to hear him beg. Arthur let his own pleasure build higher before he relented. "Now, Eames," he ordered, sharp despite the cresting of his own orgasm. He felt Eames' cock swell inside him as they came together, white seed painting over the black of Eames' tattoos. *~*TEXT*~*

A portal opened and a voluptuous young man who looked like Sven but with a bad haircut stepped out.   "Hi my name is Shiro I have come to do the smexy things with you"  "How did you get here you hunky piece of wood?"  "Idk plot-hole?"  "What?"  "What?"  "*something about realities*"  Shiro was overcome by lust from Slav's sexy voice and everyone immediately started making out and touching the butts. It. Was. HAWT. Shiro and Sven started rubbing Slav's tiddies and he convulsed like a sexy snake. Soon they got tired and Shiro was weirded out cause it looked like he just fucked a clone of himself. Slav then realized that this was the reality where Shiro was a sleeper agent clone so he wrapped his body around Sven's neck and he died while having and orgasm but this time he didn't go to the space hospital so now he is dead. *~*TEXT*~*

Poe runs his hands over Finn's shoulders and tips his head aside, sending Finn's mouth down his jaw and neck.     Written by  Spacepilotprince . *~*SUMMARY*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Khal Drogo grunts, chest heaving like one of his stallions as she timidly wraps her hands around his cock. The skin feels practically feverish, and she wonders: do all Dothraki feel this way?   The smell is potent: sweat, stallion, blood and their bodies. The taste is an overwhelming musk which coats her tongue as he thrusts. His hips buck up and down, alternating between riding their bed and fucking her mouth.   With her jaw aching, Daenerys sniffles. Her breaths are short, threatening to become frightened.   He grunts louder, sliding his fingers into her hair. The command: stay still.   She does. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Irene has velvety soft skin; a sharp contrast to her past lovers, to her skin. Freckles spatter her breasts, stopping short of her dark brown nipples. Her stomach is creamy pale with hints of silvery stretch marks.  Mystique watches her milky eyes as she runs her hands up her stomach. The skin is still smooth. Smooth and normal to the touch.  The bump of her spines layering her breasts causes her fingers to curl, though she doesn't pull away.  “You're tickling my fingers,” she laughs, stroking her fingertips across her breasts, “It's new, but I love it.” “I love you.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Sansa learns to enjoy pleasure once more. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Sansa fantasizes about feasts as she traces the outline of her slender ribs. Her skin will lose its sag. A corset will lift her breasts once more. Beautiful gowns are going to hide her trauma with layers of fabric.   Fantasizing over feasts and gowns isn't enough to dampen her thighs, but she lazily strokes her pearl. The tingle is foreign, nearly forgotten under memories of cruel hands. Her outer walls are squishy, cushioned with fine red hairs; the inside smooth and silky.   Free of cruel hands, Sansa closes her eyes. She lands into a feast, staining her corset and gown. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Gendry huffs, digging his fingers into the mattress as Arya prods him again. “When am I supposed to start liking this? Actually, where did you learn this trick?” Mercifully, she removes her inexperienced fingers, allowing him to roll over.  The muscle and weight lost to the trauma of her childhood are permanently gone. In their place, she's grown lean and quick. Her breasts are small, her hip bones sharp.  She wraps her battle worn, calloused fingers around his cock. The first stroke is quick - more a tug. She flicks her wrist, smirking as he grits his teeth.  “You start now.” *~*TEXT*~*

Alec blinked a couple of times and stumbled foward, having enough thought to set down his bow and kick off his boots before he was kneeling over Magnus and kissing him. Magnus moaned again, wrapping one arm around the shadowhunter.   "Did you have a good day at work?"  Alec nodded, sitting back and watching Magnus finger himself. "Magnus, you knew I was coming."  "I know, but I couldn't wait," Magnus replied, adding another finger and watching as Alec bit his lip and groaned, one hand moving to palm the front of his pants. "I thought I would get a head start."  Alec groaned again, moving in for another kiss and undoing his belt. "Well, I'm here now."  Magnus laughed and nodded. "So hurry up and fuck me." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The blood runs trough her back, the tears fall out of her eyes and the screams jump out her mouth.  One more time Vanessa was punishing herself for sleeping with Mina.  She remembers that all started with a innocent kiss when both of them had seven years of age.  At ten they passed to touch one another and stayed like this for a long time until finally at fourteen started to warm up their beds.  Vanessa knew it was wrong. She knew it was a sin. And was because of it that soon after sinning with Mina, she locked herself in her room and whipped till the day was done.  Ives wish she could finish with that, but she can't. Because even being a sin, Vanessa liked to feel Harker's skin touching her flesh. *~*TEXT*~*

With desperate passion borne of forbidden love, he trailed kisses to her neck and raked his teeth across her flesh.  “Cullen,” she croaked.  Warm juices flooded his balls as her muscles contracted around him. He braced himself for his own release.  “Solona.”  The echo of a clipboard striking stone stopped his heart.  “Apologies for the interruption, Commander. Your Majesty. I'll be in my office if you need me.”    *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*23 rimming（雷瑞）（窒息高潮） “啊哈……抓到你了~”雷狮愉悦地哼出欢快的调子，他打了个响指，慢慢悠悠地走到被禁锢在角落的人面前。 “你要逃到哪里去？”雷狮眯起眼睛，修长的手指不紧不慢地解下头上画有星星的头巾，他知道对方不会回答，这种说了也是白说的问题不过是他打发现下空寂气氛的慰藉品，自说自话的本领在遇见这个人之后向来是逐日攀升的，他喜欢对方那副寡言的模样，冷清又高傲的神情总让人有种无端的毁灭欲。 他是世间无人可及的珍宝，而他则是无所不用夺尽一切珍宝的海盗。 “最大的好处，一定是属于我——雷狮的。”语气嚣张又霸道。 格瑞微微仰起头，他抬起眼皮，一双冷目平静地注视着对方，“雷狮，”他的嗓子似乎受了伤，声音没了往日的爽利，反而有着破风箱转动的感觉，“够了。” “真是糟糕的话呢。”雷狮一副浑然不介意的样子，他好似完全没有察觉出对方语气里暗藏的危险，仍旧自顾自地将头巾拽住，俯身绕上对方白皙的脖颈，交叉，然后用力一拉—— “唔——！咳呃、咳！”格瑞大约也是没料到他忽然来这么一手，没有任何预料和准备，咽喉处传来的不适感带来了死亡的气息，被死死锁住的双手徒劳地做着挣扎的无用功，额上暴起的青筋在涨红的脸上愈发明显。 雷狮双手力度不变，嘴角咧开弧度，他微微张开双唇，吐出轻柔的话语：“你果然还是不说话更可爱一些哦？” 格瑞如濒死的鱼在案板上弹跳那般全凭求生的本能在挣扎，大脑缺氧造成耳眼同步失灵，熟悉的音节喝醉了一样摇摇晃晃着分辨不清，视线渐渐被泪水覆盖，最后只剩下刺目的光亮，斑驳着沦为黑暗。 “唔呃……啊！”格瑞痛苦地呻吟着，窒息感掩盖了身下的动静，他甚至毫无察觉后穴被巨物进入。雷狮显然也知晓对方已经腾不出多余的感受分给身下，干脆连前戏都草草解决，直接抽下腰带挺身捅入。 视线已经全部归于暗色，入眼却又是一片苍白，极昼与极夜在此刻淋漓汇聚、交融，最后合为一体。 谁都不曾退步，于是二者得以完整存在。 痛，太痛了。 格瑞已经完全喘不上来气，红色的舌头在口腔内乱晃一气，像是在寻找求生的出路。 然而他早已无路可逃。 雷狮欣赏着对方难得一见的狼狈模样，一边熟练地给予贪婪吮吸的后穴忠实的快感。他亲吻着隐隐渗出血丝的喉结，两侧的肌肤早已红肿不堪。直到那人连粗喘都渐渐失力，振如雷鼓的心跳趋于迟缓，他才颇有些恋恋不舍地卸了手上的力气，即使他自己的双臂也开始肌肉泛酸。 氧气再度鼓入胸腔的感觉让格瑞以为得到了救赎的新生，剧烈颤动的气管拼命摄取着方才急缺的气体，半挺的性器似乎也受了传染，猛然之间也粗了一圈，高高的昂着头，以致雷狮再一次撞击到那一点时毫不犹豫地喷薄出白浊。 “我们应该去尝试在水下……”雷狮很满意对方的表现，作为奖励，他温柔地舔去方才留下的青紫色勒痕处的血滴。“我相信，你在那儿的感觉一定更棒……” 格瑞失神地瘫在对方怀里，大脑因高度缺氧而罢工此时仍未连上线。“哈啊……”他无意识地摇晃着头颅，嘴边留下晶莹的涎水。 “真是可爱啊……”雷狮低低地笑起来， “我无声的恋人~” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*程士高到底还是挨了打，即使没有伤筋动骨那么严重，后腰上也难受得很。 李玉堂拿手撑在他上方不敢用力，就那样虚着一点力气低下头，无声无息地接受那个亲吻。 程士高抱着他翻了个身，把人压在身体下面——李玉堂这一天晚上难得的特别配合，程士高顺着他的脸颊亲吻下去，他就扬起下巴，毫无保留地暴露出自己的咽喉，由着对方舔弄刺戳；程士高在他身上稍稍往上一顶，挤压着他的身体和腰胯，被李玉堂咬着牙吞咽回去的呻吟声就再也遮不住了，丝丝缕缕地透出来。 如果是在往常，程士高能在他身上折腾好一阵，磨得李玉堂忍不住松口。 但这次，程士高亲吻着他的喉结，直接把手从李玉堂的裤腰上伸进去，往下一扯，紧跟着低伏下身体，把李玉堂含到了嘴里——那种骤然被温暖柔软的口腔包裹起来的刺激，让李玉堂一下子绷紧了脊背。 他还从来没有尝试过这个，李玉堂禁欲感由来已久，除了程士高谁有胆子跟他在这种事情上放肆。李玉堂受了那一下刺激之后，很快忍耐住，重新躺回到原来的位置上，但程士高竖起舌尖，一下一下地刺戳，模仿他射精的动作——李玉堂攥着手，摩挲着紧握住床头的横栏：越是刺激就越是不肯出声。 程士高抬起头来漱口，李玉堂以为那就结束了。他伸长了手指，舒展了一下被紧握到泛白的指节，闭上眼睛深深吸了一口气。 然而，还没等他完全放松，程士高的舌头就又回到了原位——这一次比刚才还要过分，不再是那样的温热，而是发凉：冰凉的还有点儿刺痛感。  程士高在舌根底下压着小小一块冰，几乎觉察不到的尺寸：刚才趁着漱口他悄悄含进去的。  那一小块儿冰将化未化，程士高用舌头推挤开李玉堂中间的那道细缝，顺着那道小孔把冰粒推进去一点点——冰其实很小，就这么一会的功夫也就全化了；但在李玉堂感受来，却完全不是那么回事，他猛地咬住了牙齿，把脱口而出的呻吟咽下去，下意识地要把程士高推开：他有的部位原本就耐受不住刺激，程士高含着冰粒去碰，李玉堂只觉得全身都升起一股高涨的酸疼，几乎当场就想要射出来。 程士高攥住他反抗的那条手腕，抚摸着李玉堂手背上的筋脉纹路，让他把手放在自己头顶。  舌尖上尝到的液体，很快渗出了腥味。 李玉堂放在他头顶的手忽然用力，程士高顺着他的力气把李玉堂完全含进去，让他射在自己嘴里。  其实刚刚李玉堂推他，就是觉得自己快要受不了了；没想到程士高不动。 李玉堂喘着气从床上挣扎起身，拿手给程士高接着，想让他吐出来；而程士高轻轻推开李玉堂的手，凑到李玉堂嘴边，把没能完全咽下去的液体推进李玉堂的口中——手上紧紧搂着李玉堂的后背不让他动，空闲的另一手缓慢地撸动。 “你怎么这么禁不住折腾？”程士高笑着明知故问。 李玉堂给他自己的东西呛了一口，脸上笼着一层难以启齿的恼怒。  可这会儿他已经没了多少力气，程士高搂着他，他也挣脱不开。程士高的手顺着他的下腹抚摸进去，一点一点耐着性子给他扩张，李玉堂的恼怒忽然就断了线，他被揉搓顶弄得难以支撑，只能够伸手揽住程士高的肩膀，把额头抵在那人身上。 他的身体实在太熟悉这样的感觉了，到了这个地步，即使想要反抗也无从着力。 程士高的笑声闷在李玉堂的肩颈之间，程士高问：“你想留我在广州？” 李玉堂咬着牙，放松身体让程士高顶进来。 他不说话，程士高故意磨他敏感的位置，磨得李玉堂前端再吐出点儿东西，磨得李玉堂连呼吸都放软——但事实上，即使李玉堂不回答，程士高也能够猜出答案：他挑在这时候想给自己过生日，可不就是为了留他再在广州多呆两天。 这人跟人，一旦有了感情，可不就是想要天天都能见着，不愿意分开。 程士高一下下顶他，李玉堂的话也断断续续，他轻声叫了一声程士高——程士高抬起眼睛看他，却发现李玉堂闭着眼睛把手背搁在额头上，他颤抖着，用一种类似哀求的声音叫程士高，“你——你能不能——” “什么？”程士高的声音也不怎么平稳，他碾压过李玉堂身体深处的那一小片区域。  李玉堂一下子捂住了嘴，眉尖都蹙起来——他们老太太还在隔壁，李玉堂就是这时候再想放纵，也不敢真地叫喊。 程士高就亲吻住他，把他的呻吟和哀求都吞下去。  ——李玉堂原本是想问他能不能不回去上海。 他实在是等怕了。 重光、少白、还有他大哥……走了就再也没有回来。 最难做的人，是像他这种被留在原地。 对着程士高李玉堂又说不出口。  程士高又问了一遍，李玉堂捂着嘴不说话，因为酸涩的苦楚而用另一只手抵着程士高的肩把他往外推，结果一下子没用对力气，手腕上一滑，反倒让程士高趁虚而入地凑到了跟前——那动作得就更狠了。李玉堂即使捂着嘴都没能把叫喊完全憋回去。 程士高贴着他，尽管还有点儿逗弄人的笑意，但他的声音却难得认真，他说：“我回来——我一准儿……下个月回来。”他喘着气，意有所指地拿拇指在李玉堂饱受折磨的前端位置上滑动，“我教给你的东西——你都还没学会呢。我哪儿舍得不回来。” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*When Harry’s down on his knees, sporting that new shorrrt haircut, Cisco automatically goes to stroke his fingers through his hair–nope, no locks, no gorgeous floof, his talented digits pausing to flex in the air where the beloved strands would be.   So he adjusts, tentatively explores and pets and pets, scritches at Harry’s scalp, and   Harry  hums,  quite satisfied. Cisco can feel the charge of it at the base of his spine as he resists rocking (unless otherwise cued).  When Harry speeds up, shows some extra  verve , Cisco flails the tiniest bit. Then, one hand grasps at Harry’s nape, warmly cupping along the back of his neck, and the fingers of the other move to gratefully knead at his firm shoulder.   Eventually, Cisco simply clings for dear life as his mind whites out.  *~*TEXT*~*

Bain groaned as Ryder tried to swallow, his throat moving around his cock. Two taps on the back of Bain’s calf and he loosened his grip, watching as Ryder pulled himself off of the other mans cock, gasping for breath.  “You’re doing so good Little Duck,” Bain said smoothly, his hand sliding down Ryder's face and going to his chin. He grinned as he wiped away a line of precome that glistened on the younger man’s chin before pulling him up into a kiss. “Let’s see if you’re really deserving of that last name of yours,” Bain said again, one hand reaching down to grab at the firm globes of Ryder’s ass. *~*TEXT*~*

Cas ran to the washroom not noticing Dean followed. Cas was sobbing when Dean grabbed his shoulder. Cas shot up and faced him. "What do you want?!" He snapped. "I was worried, I'm sorry." Dean tried to help Cas calm down but it wasn't going well. Cas finally did calm down. Dean hugged him and told him he would stay. Cas then tried to tell Dean they should leave but couldn't get the words out. Dean took Cas to his house and went to the living room hugging, Charlie and Sam. Cas waved to both people, getting a wave from Sam, and Charlie hugged him instantly. Dean went and showered but he didn't know Cas had moved to his room and laid on his bed. Dean walked into his bedroom after and saw Cas curled in his bed. Dean smiled and sat next to him. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Sharon knows how to take care of Natasha after a hard battle. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Sharon’s fingers ran through Natasha’s dirty, tangled hair, the scent of lilac shampoo washing away the stench of battle. Then they dropped lower, more soap washing across bruises and scrapes and the aches of being pummeled by Hydra agents. Finally, her fingers came to rest on Natasha’s thighs, tugging them apart in the extra wide Jacuzzi tub Sharon was glad they had. Her fingers slipped easily inside, her thumb found Natasha’s clit, her other hand squeezed a nipple and soon Natasha was moaning, hips bucking and back arching as Sharon finished making her forget that Hydra was even a thing. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Shiro was patient, like with everything that he did. Having Shiro’s lips around his cock was good and hot enough, but now lying here, as Shiro eased himself slowly, so gentle, the wait was becoming too much. He just needed Shiro. Now. Needed the bed to rock with them.   “Patient yields focus, I guess,” Keith teased. “Am I supposed to focus on how your cock feels inside me?”   Shiro raised an eyebrow and gave Keith’s ass a slap.   “Uncharted lands for both of us, cadet,” he said. “Have to do a little exploring.”   Keith chuckled. The little asshole. “Of course.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Khadgar is eager for more. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*"This time, I want to try and fit you inside me," says Khadgar, as he slicks up Durotan's cock. His human hands are dwarfed by the thick member, its veins prominent as it stands to attention. "But you are so small," says Durotan, gazing at him in concern. "And you're enormous," adds Khadgar, his wide brown eyes gleaming dangerously. "That's the point." Durotan's harsh brows knit as Khadgar pulls back and begins to finger himself open. "I fear I would hurt you, little one." Khadgar slips another finger inside himself, and shudders at the burn. "That's what I'm counting on." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Where spirit-walking often left his body cold, his lover brought back warmth.  Literally.  They enjoyed that little inside joke, the irony: revealing skin to keep warm, feeling the heat of the burning metal nearby and his lover’s cock hot and deep inside him.  Veeti would have Jaakko keep the gloves on, liking how they felt under his shirt. If Sulo ever walked in on them, it would be the biggest mess Jaakko would ever have to clean up. But it was his duty anyway, cleaning. To Veeti, this was the final sweet step coming back to the world of living. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Alfred should say no, but... *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Bruce looked glorious - sweaty yet serene - as he lowered himself onto Alfred's cock. Not a sight Alfred ever thought he would see, or should see. The rush of shame he felt only made him harder. "We shouldn't be doing this," muttered Alfred. "Why not?" Bruce sank a little lower. "We're both adults." "So many reasons." Alfred clutched at the bedsheets. Bruce narrowed his eyes, pushing down further. "Name one." "It's just... It's wrong."  And incredible.  Bruce halted, with half Alfred's dick already inside him. "Do you want me to stop?" Alfred groaned, squeezing his eyes shut. "Don't you bloody dare." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Spinning toward the future... *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The emptiness that she had felt deep inside ever since that day so long ago when N had flown far away from her, Hilda could feel it being filled now, as her fingers tangled into long hair.  A gasp sounded out in the otherwise silent Nimbasa hotel room. Whether belonging to N or herself, Hilda couldn’t say, her head spinning like that ferriswheel.  They were completely one in that moment, as he moved inside of her, all tangled limbs and bunched sheets. Kisses and sighs spun out like candyfloss; it was their little amusement park, love the only ticket required. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Roche gives into these encounters far easier than he should. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The blade pressed beneath his chin made Roche freeze. Shoved against a wall, Roche cursed his traitorous cock hardening.   His pants are unfastened and shoved to his knees before a hand clenched painful tight around Roche’s length, causing him to hiss.  A tongue licked across the curve of his ear as a hard cock pressed into his body, drawing a moan from him, the sound more pleasure than pain.   “Such a whore for this,” Iorveth mocked, fingers digging into Roche’s hips as he set a brutal pace, ignoring Roche’s protesting sound. “You come on my cock or not at all.” *~*TEXT*~*
