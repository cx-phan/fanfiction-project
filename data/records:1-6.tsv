Misaki swore and settled in beside him, soothing hand on his back. ""C'mon, let's get you up.""  He didn't know how to get up, his paws not working right, and Misaki wanted him on only two.

The day the music ended, was the day Rogue had put his hand through Sting's stomach, as dragons destroyed the world around them.  Sting had smiled at him, his half transformation into a dragon fading, and he'd thanked Rogue even as he'd bled out.  Thanked him for saving his soul.  As Sting died in his arms, so too did the music in Rogue's heart.  Replaced only by a soundless void, that ached for the bright melody it had once known.  And he resolved, in that moment, to do whatever was necessary to bring it back, to undo all that had befallen them.  Even if it meant sacrificing everything else.

It was girls poker night but it stopped being poker night over an hour ago, when Kate pulled out a bottle of Zelenka's rotgut moonshine that they cut into increasingly smaller portions of Gangu'ua juice. It wasn't the best mixed-drink if you were judging by the taste, but they weren't drinking for the buzz tonight.   Laura lifted her hand, scratching at the back of her neck, shivering when she scraped the short hairs at the back of her neck instead of catching whispy strawberry blonde hair.   'You know, I never regained consciousness. My body, never regained consciousness. It fell to the floor, and three hours later, flatlined.'

He walked into the bakery in almost a trance, and came out with a bread roll, crusty and heavy in his palm. The smell was intoxicating; it brought back a wealth of memories, happy times with other people and the sickening horror of his arrest. Every thing about that bread roll filled him with hunger. and sickness. and lust. He stuffed the entire roll in his mouth, and his eyes rolled back as he was overwhelmed with sensation. The crunch of the crust, the dense crumb, the sour tang all through the bread. He staggered on his feet with the sensation. Then he swallowed, and the ecstasy of the bread was gone, only a memory once more.

Here in what Elijah always thought of as  Sean's Woods , the freshly-fallen snow remained pristine, except for the tracks of the small creatures who lived there, and who only ventured out of their lairs and nests to find food.  No plows disturbed the white blanket that covered the green, allowing nature to take its course, and the snow to melt instead of being forcibly removed. When he and Sean added their own tracks in the snow, careful to keep to a narrow path and not disturb the beauty, it felt to Elijah as if they were in a fantasy world, one far removed from the reality of everyday life.
