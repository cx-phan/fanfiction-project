But these are dinosaurs, so they sound like they're speaking old English.  Maybe the T-rex is speaking like Shakespeare or the Apatosaurus talk like something out of Pride &amp; Prejudice.

However, she wouldn't actually tell you who her girlfriend is, because their relationship is a secret.  You see, her girlfriend is Momoe, the coach of her team. Which means their relationship comes with a big age gap and a power imbalance and is skirting the boundaries of whether it is illegal or not. Even if it is illegal, she doesn't care. She loves Momoe, and she never wants to leave her.  So she can't tell people who she is dating, even if she wanted to. And this means that whenever they kiss, they have to make sure that nobody can see them.  Which means whenever they're getting out the equipment before baseball practise and happen to find themselves alone, Shinooka reaches up and gives her girlfriend a discreet kiss.  Yeah, this relationship is definitely problematic, but Shinooka doesn't care. She just wants to experience this for as long as she can.  She never wants this to end.

The big toe on each foot is pulled back tight and secured to his padded ankle cuffs. That cock ring is attached to the outer wall, meaning Sniper can't pull his hips back AT ALL.  And Spy is a sadistic, cock-teasing motherfucker who has clearly been at work already.  Scout is just getting his jollies digging into those exposed soles and dragging his blunt nails over Sniper's heels and toes.  He likes the desperate wiggling the best, but the muffled screaming he hears is almost as good.  He might just drop his pants, lube up and fuck the space between Sniper's feet, but he wants to enjoy this by itself for a while. An added bonus to Sniper's torture is that Spy and Scout can't see or hear each other, so their attacks on him are random and uncoordinated, making it even more unbearable.

How did you know I would be the one to come, and not someone else?'  Hanzo pants, whining.  'You always come on my heat.'              'I come off your heat too.' Reaper removes his gloves, pressing two fingers into him slowly. Hanzo shudders, reaching back to spread his cheeks for him.              'Fuck me, please.'              'Working on it, dragon.' Reaper pulls his cock out, stroking it to hardness as he watches slick drip from Hanzo's hole. He presses in, pulling Hanzo back onto his cock. He fucks him fast. Hanzo comes twice in a row almost immediately, screaming into the pillow. Reaper fucks his knot in and out of him until it swells. He fucks in hard, knotting him. Hanzo sobs into the pillow, clenching around Reaper's knot. Reaper strokes a hand down Hanzo's back.              'Satisfied?'              'Mmm. For now.'              'We have your entire heat, love.'	Blackberry Dragon	198	Explicit	A very short ficlet for my valentine	1	2019-02-16	0

I held his soul within my small hands,I didn't want to let him go. He holds me just as closely. He's warm. I could hear his raspy voice gently whispering in my ear. I could not understand him, the only words I could comprehend was:  'I love you.'  I couldn't tell if it was true or not at this point. I held his soul tighter. He quivers. Breath becoming heavier. The room was dark. The only thing that lit up the dark place was his orange soul. Illuminating both our faces. His face was orange too, but not from the glow. I placed my lips onto his soul. He shivers. I want to see it again, so I repeated my action. He grips the back of my clothes.

Can't wait to see you...""  He pressed the blade against the fragile skin, feeling his blood boiling while it dripped down his chest. Harder, harder.

He likes holding one of her wrists in an iron tight grip above her head while forcing the other to hold the doorknob to this room he's forbidden her to ever go into. His cock fucks her roughly from behind, he pants like a rabid animal in her ear and sinks his teeth into the skin of her neck so hard she thinks he means to draw blood, and for the entire time her hands must remain in place or he'll stop and make her put them back, his own hand such a crushing, white knuckled thing on top of her own on the doorknob that she doesn't know if he's trying to stop her from turning the knob or trying to make her do it instead.  Because sometimes it's like he doesn't just  expect  her to break her promise to not go into the room, it's like he  wants  her to do it and every day she doesn't is some kind of foreplay – her teasing him, drawing out his frenzy, until the moment of climax.
