*~*SUMMARY*~*With Jane in her arms Sif can't feel too lost. (Written for Femslash February 2019. Sif/Jane, AU, complete.) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*It's easy to feel lost, now that Asgard is gone. She spends much time on Earth now, helping Thor's new band of warriors defeat their foes. But this, Sif thinks, is where she can feel at home even with Asgard naught but a memory. She rests her head on Jane's hair and breathes in the smell of Earth flowers. Incredible how much wonder and passion can fit into Jane's slight frame. The marvel of Midgardians. Here, she is content. With Jane by her side or Thor at her back inbattle she is the most herself. And not at all lost. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*The king's golden touch does not please everyone. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*“Such wonderful news from the war, my lady! The king has swept all before him.”   Miriel mustered a smile for the benefit of her attendant, a high born Númenorean woman who normally displayed considerably less sound good sense than the palace cat.   From the size of the force her husband had taken across the sea, she would have been very surprised if he’d returned with his tail between his legs.  For all his arrogance, he was a strong leader with a golden touch, and his men would follow him anywhere.  As would the women of the palace.  All except her. *~*TEXT*~*

Victor Fleming, 1939) Avengers Fairy Tales, No. 4 (Marvel, 2008)  Tickled by the challenge playlist for guest of honor  Kelly Sue DeConnick , I figured I could manage a one-shot vid for the  Emerald City  episode that she wrote. It seemed appropriate to choose another song from the same album, and "Look Into My Eyes" was the shortest! It was perfect for the theme of media authorship as adaptation and transformation. I wanted to incorporate some comics since that's DeConnick's primary oeuvre. Did I know that Marvel did an Avengers reimagining of  The Wizard of Oz ? I did not! I found that by looking on Wikipedia. *~*TEXT*~*

When I developed the concept, did I know that George Clinton put out a Metropolis-themed music video in 1996? I did not!

*~*SUMMARY*~*A drabble about the colour green and what it means to Kara. Established supercorp. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The colour green was a complex one. There’s Kryptonite, the one substance that could render Kara powerless, strip her of her strength, the one thing she prized so greatly. The green, whilst it looked bright, she associated with fearful, painful days spent in the DEO medbay, feeling empty- as if every fibre of her being had been drained from her. Heavy limbs, heavy head,  a fog so thick she couldn’t function, sinking lower and lower and lower… Only to be pulled out of this spiral by the same colour which plunged her down into it. Bright green eyes, like jade, but somehow more pure and wild. The same green eyes that she wakes up to every morning, the same green eyes that glint with mischief, the same green eyes that fill with tears when she receives the same call from Alex because ‘damn it Kara why do you have to be so selfless’, the same green eyes that comfort her, the same green eyes that she fell in love with the second she saw them. The eyes of Lena Luthor. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*There’s a light kiss pressed so softly on her forehead, if she’d not been awoken by the sound of Charlotte entering moments ago, Becky wouldn’t have felt it. She wouldn’t have heard Charlotte’s soft words, as she laid it all on the line to the beautifully unconscious Becky - because that was the only way Charlotte could get it out. She would have never known. . .  And as Charlotte drifts off, she’s now left to wonder how much of this had she missed. How many visits hadn’t woken her up. And what exactly Charlotte had said in her previous unheard midnight whispers. *~*TEXT*~*

Arthie rolls her eyes and then settles herself back down against Yoyo again.   "Wake me up when we get there", she mutters softly in Yolanda's shoulder.   The other woman smiles, places a quick peck on Arthie's forehead and whispers,  "Alright, baby". *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*You stared down at the adorable man on his knees before you. His dark eyes were doe-like, holding his love for you, his question, and a hint of determination.   You knew he wanted this more than anything, wanted you more than anything, and you weren’t giving him an answer right away because you just wanted to stay in this moment for a while. You wanted to etch the way he was gazing up at you into your mind, memorize the exact notes his voice had taken when he asked, “Will you be my wife?”  But when you noticed the lines of his face begin to fall and the resolve in his brown orbs falter, you realized you could not take your time any longer.   You joined him on the floor, your arms going to wrap around his neck as his palms found the small of your back, and pressed a kiss to his eyelid, “Yes, my love.”  His hold on you tightened, and he buried his head into the crook of your neck.   “Thank you.”  “No, Thomas,” you hummed against his cheek. “Thank you.”  He was the best birthday gift ever given to you. *~*TEXT*~*

She could not help gasping, or her eagerness in pulling that one apart to find Garibaldi, and then Franklin, and then Sheridan.  "Matryoshka dolls," Susan said, before opening Sheridan… to see herself, and knew one remained. Her fingers shook at revealing Talia.  "She is always within you," Delenn said softly. *~*TEXT*~*

This being a common name, generic anti/hero and name-of-all-trades. And there was, of course a big bad wolf.   Beginning There is: Winter, a forest, a basket, a path. Innocent and smiling girl heads to her doom. (Oncemorewithfeeling.) Events fall out of sequence.   Middle The basket falls and the ice on the path crack/splinters/changes/is changed/nothing (delete as applicable). This is an important lesson. About time. Dramatic licence prevails in a series of unlikely but significant events.   Begin Again Once upon a time there was. A time. Which was eaten. By a sheep dressed as a wolf.   End Happily, they all lived. (Never after.) In other versions, Red and the wolf eat Granny. Apocryphally, reality shifts back to normal. More or less. Less. Yes. Or. Choose your own adventure. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Ramses is the worst thing that ever happened to him. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*   Juno’s fingers clenched around the edge of the desk. “You’re the worst thing that ever happened to me.”  Ramses chuckled, almost cruelly, his fingers idly trailing down Juno’s exposed back. “But I’m the best thing that happened to this city.”  Juno grit his teeth. From the window behind Ramses’ desk Hyperion City sprawled up to the horizon. A sea of blinking lights and fluorescent signs under the stars. Large and ugly and the most precious jewel in the universe.  “And isn’t that worth more, Juno?” Ramses asked, lips grazing the shell of his ear.  Juno didn’t know what to say. He wanted to rant, wanted to yell. Ends didn’t justify means. But the people of Hyperion City, all of them, even the ones in Old Town, had never been better of.   So he just turned his head and covered Ramses in bruising kisses as the old man laughed at him.       *~*TEXT*~*

He remembers the imagined touch of hands and deadly nails causing blood to well up and slip along his skin, and he remembers the brief excitement, a chill running down his spine though there had hardly been time to properly rest or imagine what could happen if they did.  The hands on him now are a ghost of what he had wanted lifetimes ago, but they are a reminder of what he never got to really feel for himself.  If he had not died then, perhaps he would have gotten to feel it.  But there was no use dwelling on the past. *~*TEXT*~*

He didn’t.  Which is why it should...it was the easiest decision he ever made to not take them. A decision he made every morning. After breakfast. Before lunch.  That’s what people did, after all, they made choices throughout the day - like choosing not to take drugs. Choosing to occupy one’s mind with other endeavours instead. Choosing to allow a sober companion to follow you around to appease the man who technically owned your house - fine, who did own your house.   He was just choosing many, many times each day not to take drugs.  And what was life if not a long line of choices? *~*TEXT*~*

Then two eyes opened and blinked; eyes that could cut through the strongest metal and shrivel the grandest tree. Those eyes narrowed, and the Fright felt a chill run through its mind.  'What are you?' it thought, and it felt the answer almost as soon as it thought the question. It moved forward, a little terrified, but still determined.  The eyes narrowed further; those two intelligent, sharp, terrifying eyes. The Fright backed away.  'You shan't pass,' it felt. 'Not alive, at any rate.'  The Fright tried to will the Shadow away. That was not a good idea. He felt his mind lifted, and thrown into the blackness; up, up, up....and he came back down several distances away.  'That was barely scratching the surface,' the Shadow thought, and the Fright shook its heads and ran away, into the darkness behind him.  *~*TEXT*~*

The thing had been torn inside out by the wind, and was nearly unrecognizable.  “Am I not going to get any sympathy from my wife?” Mayer teased. He placed his hand on her belly, which was large with child. It was good to see her so merry in her condition, and good to have a few more months of being just the two of them, before they could welcome their little son or daughter into the world.  Esther’s smile softened. “I have no sympathy for foolish men who go out to watch thunderstorms,” she said. “But I do have soup and dry clothes. Now come inside.” *~*TEXT*~*

It was so much worse when rational human beings, who ought to know better, decided that five AM was the time to waltz around the rooftops, being shrill and operatic. For the third day in a row David was torn from his dreams by a loud and triumphant high note. He flopped over in bed to try and block it out, and that’s when he noticed Sarah peering out the window through her lace curtains.  “She always hangs up the laundry at this time,” Sarah breathed.  “I know.”  “She’s beautiful and I have to meet her.” Sarah’s blush was not lost on David, but he chose to ignore it.  “Good idea. Tell her that some of us like to sleep.”  Sarah had no answer for this. She rolled her eyes, and clambered out the window, probably in pursuit of their mysterious singing neighbor.   Now I can get some rest , David told himself, but this resolution didn’t last for long. Within a few minutes curiosity got the best of him, and he took over Sarah’s place at the window, to peer out and watch the scene unfold. *~*TEXT*~*

He ran his hand down through it, to the nape of Blink’s neck. “It’s just starting to hide your face is all.”  “Yeah?” Blink’s voice was a lot softer now, and he leaned back against Mush’s touch. “You know the first thing about cutting hair?”  Mush bit back a laugh. “No, but I seen folks doing it. How hard could it be?”  Later Blink would joke that Mush had hypnotized him into letting him give him a haircut. Mush didn’t know what that meant. What he did know was the the cut was uneven and unruly, and yet somehow Blink still said it was the best one he’d ever had. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Shigaraki is a precocious child. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*The sound of barking was noticeably absent when All for One came home. Tomura must have tired out the puppy. It was a gift and a lesson all in one: how to take care of your subordinates, how to inspire loyalty, how to dispose of something that had outlived its usefulness. Knives were best honed on steel, after all. Tomura was in the living room, playing a video game next to a pile of fur and blood. “It annoyed me,” he stated without looking away from the screen. All for One smiled. “My, Tomura, you certainly are a precocious child.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Spot hated the cold. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Spot hated the cold. It reminded him of being a little kid with holes in his boots and too much pride to bellyache when snow and sleet made his toes numb. He’d spent so much of his life being impenetrable, even when the chill reached right down to his bones.  Spot’s life was different now. He had sturdy steel toed boots. He had Crutchie who got up an hour before him to go to his teaching job, left a cup of hot coffee in the kitchen, and wrote out the words “good morning” in the frost on his car windshield. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*“Where did you hear that?”  Les blinked sleepily. He’d been dreaming, again, all about singing in a concert stadium full of adoring fans. Now David was shaking him awake, with a glare and a sour expression.  “Hear what?” Les asked.  “You were singing about tractors.” David said  tractor  as though it was a dirty word, but Les just smiled.  “Jack was playing that song in his car. It was really funny.”  David rolled his eyes, the way he often did when anybody mentioned Jack. “I should have known,” he muttered, turning over in his bed to go back to sleep. Les did the same, hoping he could get back to his dream of country music stardom. Or maybe pop music stardom, or even Broadway theatre. He wasn’t picky. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Crutchie shares his breakfast and his dreams with Jack. *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Every morning, the nuns went out on their carriage over by the church with their basket of bread, and every day there was less bread than there were hungry newsies. Crutchie was always among the first to be fed, even when he tried to hang back, seeing as he wasn’t any more destitute than the rest of the boys.  This morning, he tore off a piece of his bread to give to Jack, who tried to wave it away. Crutchie pressed the morsel into Jack’s hand, and leaned in to whisper in Jack’s ear.  “Pancakes,” he said. “And bacon. That’s what I’m going to make for us first chance I get.”  Jack just grinned. “We'se both of us the kind of guys who could burn water, and you know it.”  “Maybe,” Crutchie said. “If that’s all we got to burn, but one of these days I’m going to get ahold of syrup, flour, and milk, and burn us some pancakes.” *~*TEXT*~*

It goes in and out, at the pace I set. It won’t stop unless I say so,” George added. “And your mouth is free to be enjoyed at the same time.”  John stripped, drunk on brandy and lust, eager to forget himself. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It was as if there was not an inch of skin on his body Hector had left untouched. From the tip of his toes to the crown of his head, all of John’s body received the attentions of Hector’s loving touches, a devoted kind of lovemaking John had never dreamt of.  Much to his embarrassment, that first time John had spilled before Hector even got close to his prick, but it made no difference. Hector smiled and looked into John’s eyes, his kisses a benediction as he licked John’s cock back to hardness, his mouth giving such tender, devastating pleasure. *~*TEXT*~*

Steve meets his eyes through the mirror without moving, as Bucky's still fixing the wig. "What? You mean a suckjob?" The slight nods from each of them compliment the range of expressions on their faces, from shock to curiosity to horror. He leans forward and applies the Victory Red lipstick he lifted from Peggy. Steve smacks his lips and admires his thin shoulders in the fancy dress. "Oh please, like this is the worst I've done." *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*John knelt in the middle of the hotel room, hands cuffed behind his back and head bowed. Before Zoe got there Harold had him strip, if only for the pleasure of watching goosebumps rise up on John's skin in the cool air.   Zoe let Harold take her coat, then walked a circle around John, taking in his lowered head, his evident hardness and the police-issue handcuffs keeping his hands back.    She lifted the chain with one toe, arching John's arms upward behind his back. "Surely he can get out of those?"   Harold said, "The point, I believe, is that he will not."   John, meanwhile, silently leaned forward in the painful position, head pressed into his thighs and his arms raised high. Harold ruffled his fingers through the short hair. He was so good at this, John, so pliant and willing.   Zoe opened her purse and took out the black leather harness and a thick green dildo ridged with veins. She pushed the straps of her dress from her shoulders and shivered out of her dress. "Let's get started then."   Under Harold's fingers, he felt John shiver, watched his breathing accelerate, and he smiled. "Certainly, Ms Morgan," he said. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*又是一个雨天。 香港的夏季总是多雨的，雨天沉闷，李问总会回忆起一些不那么美好的事。  李问把架在鼻梁上的眼镜摘下放在一旁，厂房的窗子略有脏污，此刻被倾盆的雨冲刷着，画得一道一道的。 他看不太清楚，也不愿再戴上眼镜，便虚虚地望着窗外。鑫叔抱着臂一步步挪过来，跟他一起看。身后人像的临摹已接近结尾，进度顺利得很。  “怎么了？画累了休息会儿？”鑫叔开口，李问不知道飘到哪儿的思绪顿时被拽了回来。他解开衬衫领口的纽扣，轻轻抿着双唇，朝着鑫叔摇了摇头。 “没怎么……进展顺利的话，今晚就能完工。”  到了晚上，桌边的李问被众人簇拥着，管家开了瓶香槟庆祝。 李问略有腼腆地笑着，吴复生亲自给李问倒了杯酒，端到他面前。 “阿问。这杯给你。”  吴复生的唇角至眉眼间尽是笑意，那对桃花眼只消凝视着李问，就轻易将其拖入深渊。  雨一直没有停。 李问在被吴复生带进房间的路上，甚至还分心听了听雨声。他们的脚步急切，踏在楼梯上略显杂乱无章。吴复生将门狠狠带上，那扇木门哀嚎着，而后被落锁。李问矮吴复生一些，此刻被后者按在门板上，他们唇舌交缠。 没人问为什么，一切就那么顺其自然地发生了。  这感觉很怪。  李问在清晨——睡醒前，总会翻几个身，在跟着吴复生来到香港之后更是如此。他一向睡眠浅，此刻身侧陌生的温度更是马上唤醒了他。花去几秒钟确认身侧的人不是阮文后，李问终于意识到，自己正背对着吴复生，被他揽在怀中，前一夜的疯狂几乎只一秒钟便冲进了他的脑海。 情欲、愧疚——或是其他什么缥缈的情感，伴着记忆一同冲刷着他。  想象中的尴尬对话并没有进行，吴复生醒来后，朝着李问若无其事地道了声早安，随后便钻进了浴室，留下李问一个人坐在床上，靠怀中的被子遮挡住自己身上斑驳的吻痕。  这一整夜的疯狂，就如同未曾发生过一般。而后几个月，一切如常。 李问有些不快，似乎只有自己对当晚的“错误”念念不忘，在和吴复生单独相处时总是小心翼翼。 不可否认，那是次难忘的经历，李问从没想过自己会有一天委身于人，更未想过自己会从中获取更强烈的快感。  李问没想到吴复生杀人时甚至可以眉头都不皱一下。他回头去看燃着的车，没过几秒便爆炸开来。他开始单方面地闹起别扭，对四哥，对吴复生。 “变色油墨的事，我来搞定。你不要再杀人了。”  听得这话，吴复生微笑着摔碎了手中的酒杯。  后来李问开始没日没夜地研究变色油墨的配方，他开始调配，试验——有时鑫叔看不过去，便劝他去休息，可他却置若罔闻。  他趴在地上，面前是调色盘，身旁尽是各种各样的颜料罐。脚步声骤然响起，是皮鞋踏在地板上的声音，他猜又是鑫叔，便头都不回地回了句：“我这就去休息。” 不想脚步声并未停止，皮鞋落在他身侧，来人蹲下，白色西装裤的裤脚蹭上了一点绿色油墨。  是画家。  画家戴着手套的手从李问的后腰顺着脊椎一路摸上后颈，李问僵硬地回头看他——这是自抢夺变色油墨事件后他们第一次独处。 “你怎么来了？我——我在调颜色，这里到处都是油墨，你的白西装会脏。”随后他的目光瞟到了吴复生的西装裤脚，只好闭了嘴。 “阿问。我在乎过吗？”吴复生还是在抿着唇微笑，李问放下手中的长木棍，坐起身来。  吴复生有一下没一下地捏着李问后颈那块肉，他直视着李问的双眼，像是想将李问藏匿得很好的内心看个通透一般。李问的目光躲闪，可身体却像被定住一样，无法动弹。  鬼使神差地，他们又开始接吻。李问身上的油墨尽数蹭上了吴复生的白色西装，深浅斑驳，活像设计好的花纹。  少了上一次的温柔，这次的吴复生粗暴了许多，李问几乎是被扔在床上的。面对吴复生，李问的情感太过复杂，先前的信任与迷恋，到后来的恐惧。吴复生的膝盖挤进李问的双腿之间，磨蹭着大腿内侧，他俯下身去和李问接吻，接吻间将李问身上的一件件衣物扔到一旁。 李问的颊侧泛着冷汗，吴复生太过危险，此刻嗅着他的脖颈，他活像被盯上的猎物一般不敢动弹。舌尖划过胸口，被冷风一吹，那两粒乳尖更是敏感了许多。  他们沉默着做完了全套，中间李问有几次爽到失神，却也只是望着天花板——显然吴复生对这十分不满，身下的动作更加激烈起来，迫使李问将注意力转到他身上。  “你听到了吗？” “什么？” “外面又下雨了。”  李问的双臂圈着吴复生的脖颈，双眼却不受控地浮起一层水汽。 吴复生没注意到这个，又或许只是不想注意到，他只是加快速度，在李问的体内释放出来。 李问被激得双眼合起，喟叹声中，水汽化为泪流了出来。 他也一并释放了。     END *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*I put the picture back in its place in my notebook and laid on my back so that I could look up at the blue sky and watch shapes form in the clouds as the floated by while I took in the beauty around me. I could hear birds singing and the faint sounds of hard working insects buzz in my ear, while the smell of wild flowers lingered in the background. I tried to take this moment to clear my head and let everything go that weighed heavy on my mind, not wanting to think of the stress or the hurt, but to just listen to what Mother Nature provided. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The days are beginning to meld together, I never know when one day ends and another begins. I keep myself busy every minute of the day in hopes of keeping Sean out of my mind, but it’s futile.   Every where I turn Sean is there, whether in the physical or metaphysical state. Last night I came across a piece of paper he had been scribbling on earlier. Nothing on it made sense, but I kept it anyway. Slipping it into my pocket to keep safe in case he needed it later even though I knew he didn’t. I went back to my room, barely eating any dinner only to have our favorite song playing on the radio.   Every day I wake up and hope that it will be different, that we could go back to a time when we were exploring our new found love, but life is cruel, and it mocks me. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*As I lay under the shade tree my mind wandered. Thinking about to the first time Sean and I had met. How in the beginning the two of us felt slightly out of place amongst the others, but quickly adjusted as we spent our free hours together. I felt like we had known each other for years instead of just a few months.   Before we knew it, things were wrapping and it was time for him to go home. I spent the rest of my time there alone without him. I remembered that I would spend more time with the younger crowd, trying to hide my sadness. Sure it worked for awhile; at least till I went home at night, to an empty house that reminded me that I was alone. And now all that we shared was long gone. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The unforgiving sun beat down on the prairie as I sit here waiting for the crew to set up the next scene. But I had to admit it wasn’t just the noon day sun that made things unbearable. Ever since I saw that golden haired man from my past, all I could think about was him.  Anytime he was around I would forget what I was doing and lose my lines. People were beginning to get irritated with him and he would laugh; making it even harder for me to concentrate. He was on my mind every waking moment and when I laid my head down at night. No matter what I did I couldn’t stop thinking about him and to be honest I didn’t want to.  Now I sit here waiting, waiting idly as thoughts of him creep into my mind, tormenting me over and over again. I could feel the urge growing inside me till the only thing in my head were images of Sean fucking me senseless.  Unfortunately all I could do was go back to my hotel at the end of the day and take a cold shower. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*The first signs of dawn had barely broken over the horizon casting just enough light so that I could see my way around. I had always been an early riser, never one to waste a minute of the day, spending any possible moment I could to sleep under the stars so that I might be woken by nature’s beauty.   And now since I’ve been back to this beautiful country the old habits of standing by the river’s edge allowing the soothing trickling sounds wash away the harshness of the previous day. I close my eyes and a picture is painted of a time long since passed of when I stood in a spot very much like this with a new friend; a friend whom would later become my lover till we were forced to part. *~*TEXT*~*

At first things seemed to have fallen back into place as though we had never been apart. But since, every time I pass he seems to be in a pensive state or surrounded by others preventing me from having a moment of his time alone.  I feel as though he is trying to avoid me. Avoid the issues that need to be addressed. Issues of why our relationship fell apart. Maybe back then we knew that it was just a relationship of convenience, knew that in the end it would never be. Maybe he’s moved on, found someone new. Maybe I need to move on, find someone new to forget about what we once had. Maybe what I really need is Sean *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It was one of those rare moments, one where I was able to make it home and have a few days where I could just relax and regroup.  Lately those days were few and far between.  Ever since Peter had helped me launch my career to a whole new level, I have been a gypsy on the move; constantly going from country to country for one movie or another, or to promote my new books and art.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like I don’t enjoy being busy, but now that the inevitable mile stone of turning fifty was just around the corner, I had to wonder if my body could keep up. *~*TEXT*~*

"We should leave it alone." Said Water.   "We should help them." Said Papa III.  "You help them I am leaving the band." Said Alpha.   "I am too." I Said.  "So, am I." Said Water.  "Fine, then leave." Said Papa III  We all left the band. It was not our job. We didn't want to deal with this. We didn't care. *~*TEXT*~*

"Did you like my pictures?" Tegoshi asks, his fingers playing with the hem of Massu's white shirt, taking in his scent. "I did," comes the reply, deep voice that makes Tegoshi's cock twitch.      "Show me how much"     + + +     Koyama is a bit jealous he didn't get to be the cat, but he doesn't mind at all when Tegoshi approaches him on all fours in their hotel bed like in the picture, a dangerous glance in his eyes. Koyama immediately puts his phone away and tousels his hair, eliciting a soft purr. Head on Koyama's chest, Tegoshi looks up at him with big, brown eyes that demand attention, and leader is happy to give it. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*"So, apparently the Grimm aren't feared. Is that right?" Salem asked me. I stared blankly at her and nodded.  "Well, yeah. They're not really a threat. One girl shredded a Deathstalker with a chaingun." I said to her.  "So shall I make them bigger and tougher?" Salem inquired. I shook my head and pulled out a small book.  "No... I say big things come in little packages." I showed her the book. She gleamed the cover.  "Goblin Slayer?" She asked me.  "You'll thank me later." I said. She sent me back to my world...  ...What have I wrought onto Remnant? *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Jingyan is playing with Zhanying's tits, pinching and pulling them just to feel his cock twitch in the convulsions of Zhanying's throat. His boyfriend is crying, snot running down his chin and over the stretch of his lips around Jingyan's cock.  It's a beautiful sight.   Jingyan licks his lips. Jerking his hips forward, he pushes himself an extra inch into Zhanying. "Breathe baby. Just breathe." He coos. Zhanying's spit bubbles and strings as he gags, tears running thick, face turning ruddy. Jingyan twists his fingers on Zhanying's nipples, milking him the way he knows he likes.  Zhanying's eyes roll back. Mouth going slack as he stiffens. Jingyan chuckles, looking down between Zhanying's thighs to see that he has made a mess of himself. Letting go, he pulls Zhanying off him. "Come on." He pushes at his shoulder. "Hold yourself open. I want to fuck you."  Zhanying blinks once, sniffing and rubbing the back of his hand over the mess of his face. Then, he lies back and spreads himself for Jingyan.  *~*TEXT*~*

When he opened his legs for him, And reached for him, Sought pleasure in his arms, His mouth, When in a moment of bliss he’d only thought of him, And not of any women. When he’d reached climax with his hands at his rim, With his cum inside of him, With his eyes glued to his, With no disgust, No regret, Only in love, An unholy version. Not recognised by church but by those like him, The ones that cast themselves to hell for the sake of soothing attraction, The ones born to sin. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*It's not every day Minako can dance in Moscow. So she makes a study of it.  Makes a study of Lilia Baranovskaya. Of her graceful arms, so controlled, her poise, her instant command over any room she steps in.  Of the sounds she makes when they slip the handlers and Minako has her tongue against her clit. Of the lovely, strong arch of her back when she comes. Of the concentration in her dark eyes when she returns the favor, darker when Minako clenches around her fingers.  She breathes words of loveliness and elegance, and Minako hardly breathes at all.     Lilia is not a woman easily impressed. But Minako Okugawa impresses. She can do sweetness and subtlety, then leap into passion that demands attention. She has flexibility, she has strength, stamina, but more than that she has that rare charisma that Lilia cannot look away from.  She cannot look away when Minako dances, or when they talk, or when they find a narrow hiding place. Minako shows her passion, here, too, her tongue forcing even Lilia to writhe against the wall.  And when Minako comes, her bun falling apart, skirt hiked up, she is just as beautiful as on stage. *~*TEXT*~*

Their clothes in a pile and the mirrors fogged up, they stood embracing as the hot water poured over them.  “Touch me, touch me.” Cecil panted into Carlos’s mouth as they kissed. Carlos obliged him, one hand moving down between them, grabbing hold of him and quickly bringing him to life.  “Anything else?” Carlos whispered as he stroked him.  “N-No, this is good.” Cecil moaned as he thrust into Carlos’s hand, his eyes closed and his head tilted back. Carlos quickened his speed, Cecil grunting and thrusting harder as he came.  “Don’t you need to get back to work?” Cecil asked Carlos as they lay together on the couch.  “It can wait.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*"Jingyan, if Zhanying bites my dick off because of you, I swear I'll take yours too." *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Lin Shu thumbs the stretch of Zhanying's mouth stretched around his cock, hissing when there is a catch of teeth against of skin. "Jingyan, if Zhanying bites my dick off because of you, I swear I'll take yours too. Then, your dead dick can accompany mine in the afterlife." He hisses, fingers clenching in soft dark hair.  Jingyan looks up from where he is eating Zhanying out. Spit slicked, he grins. "No, you won't. You like my dick too much." Lin Shu glares, flicking him off.  "Can you two just...? Switch off? For two seconds?" Zhanying says once he pulls himself off Lin Shu. "Please? I was having such a good- Argh! Jingyan!" He gasps, flinching when Jingyan bites down harder on his left ass cheek.  "Shit, leave the right one for me. I want to mark him too." Lin Shu says, guiding himself back into Zhanying's mouth.  Jingyan catches his eye, and it is a familiar gleam. A curl of competitiveness flares warm and low in his belly. "Make him come the most times?" Lin Shu smirks, teasing the tips of Zhanying's ears with his nails.  "You're on." Jingyan smiles serenely, pushing a finger into Zhanying. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~*Laundry day:) *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*Arthas breathed out a breathe so hard it shook his entire Arthas. He slowly slammed open the door of the laundromat, the glass instantly shattering into a million pieces. He inhaled sharply, nasally voring all the oxygen in this establishment.   He took off his shoes, his toes wiggling vigorously and he was sweating terrifyingly. Arthas from world of warcraft opened his laundry basket, pouring his disgusting lich king clothes in the laundry washer, screaming so loud it could be heard from space.   Arthas flared his nostrils at the laundry. He closed the washer. He delicately caressed the button, it was a heavy load.   Invincible waltzed into the building and Arthas cried and sobbed and wheezed.   “Invincible, my fucking horse, I’m doing my laundry.” Arthas took off his lich king hat and picked his nose.   Invincible put his hand on Arthas’s shoulder reassuringly. “I’m disappointed in you Artas.” *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*I hold the bean to my mouth. My tongue comes to lick the white indent. It drags up and down it's body, savoring the texture and flavor. My face feels hot as I pull away. I swallow, before opening my mouth. With shaky hands, I place the bean on my tongue. I close my mouth, and move it around. My heart is still beating as I graze my teeth across it length. I moan, before placing it on my molars. Once it's in position, I chomp down, exposing it's raw flavor. Again and again, I move my teeth, until it's crushed into bits. It feels grainy. It gathers in the back of my mouth. I use my tongue to find every piece, putting it all in one place. I swallow, and all at once they flood into my throat. They pierce and scratch at me. I swallow again, and I imagine each piece sinking lower into me. As the last one passes my throat, I cum. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*A pig.  That's what you have become.  A big, fat, pig.  Your gut is so full. You gave up on clothes months ago.  Pigs don't need clothes anyway.  You used to live life on your hands and knees, trailing behind your master with slow, plodding steps, ass jiggling as you moved, belly just brushing the floor.  But that's impossible now.  Your fat ass provides a cushion as you sit on the soft carpet. You haven't moved in months. You are completely immobile. Your massive belly pools in front of you, but you want more.  You always want more.  You pig.  As your master returns, you make grabby hands, thick fingers barely visible beneath the fat on your arms.   Your master has a gift for you.  The mask if settled over your mouth.  A thick liquid begins to pour down it.   You swallow and swallow and swallow.  You don't need to move.  You never need to move.  Soon you will be nothing more than a blimp of fat.  And yet, you are still hungry. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*TEXT*~*Carlos lay perfectly still as his boxers were slowly pulled down to expose him to the cold night air. A moan escaped his lips as a pair of strong hands began to knead and rub him, stopping every so often to part him, a finger tracing its way from his tailbone to his thighs, stopping to questioningly press at his most sensitive spot.   He nodded his consent, his heart racing as Cecil gently pushed his finger against him till he was in, letting Carlos adjust before he began to move it. As his pace and force increased, Cecil began to murmur soothingly to Carlos as he rubbed his back. Soon Carlos’s breath came in shallow pants, his back arching as the fire grew in his belly, his whole body spasming as Cecil drove him over the edge.  “Thank you.” Carlos murmured into Cecil’s neck.  Cecil kissed him in response, the two staring into each other’s eyes till they fell asleep. *~*TEXT*~*

*~*SUMMARY*~* *~*SUMMARY*~*
*~*TEXT*~*赵云澜闭着眼睛，他听到轻微的脚步声，走到他身前不远处，又停了下来。 他微微一笑，在床上撑起胳膊坐了起来。 “喂，你不会以为我眼睛瞎了......就不能满足你了吧。” 沈巍的身体瞬间压了上来，实打实的重量，将他猛地扑倒在了床上。 “不许胡说！"沈巍压低着声音，狠狠地威胁道。 赵云澜从喉咙发出一声愉悦的笑，然后将沈巍的衣领狠狠一揪：“那就......干我！” 没了视觉的干扰，周遭的一切变得更加敏感而暧昧。 赵云澜几近着迷地听着耳边来自沈巍的呼吸，粗重得像从喉咙深处发出，带着最幽暗的欲望，用力打在他的脸上，又沿着他的耳边来来回回。 赵云澜知道沈巍在看他，那目光有些烫，让赵云澜忍不住去想象镜片后那双被情欲熏染的眼，此刻该是怎样的深邃暗然，只因为自己。 这认知让赵云澜蓦地兴奋起来，皮肤一寸寸地起了战栗。 一只手轻轻摸上了赵云澜的眼皮，带着小心翼翼的颤抖。 赵云澜配合着眨了眨眼，一双不安分的手趁机顺着沈巍的衣摆摸了进去，一路下行抓住了他的硬挺。 入手很热，像是尚未完全苏醒，软绵绵地躺在赵云澜的手心。 他坏笑着撸了几把，如愿听到耳边的呼吸蓦地一窒，然后变得更加急促起来。 手中的阴茎开始快速地膨胀，赵云澜故意用大拇指划过那敏感的顶端，就听耳边传来近乎尖锐的急喘，带着一丝压抑的呜咽，沈巍的身体摩擦着他的狠命抖了几下。 “看来确实不用再跟你客气了。”沈巍的声音带上了情欲的沙哑，很有些咬牙切齿的狠劲。 说话间，他重重捏住赵云澜的下巴，对着那张嘴咬了上去。 黑暗之中，除了耳边交错的粗喘，只剩下彼此身体的探索。 滚烫的肉体毫无阻隔地贴在一处，传递着血脉间迸发的热情。 赵云澜仰头承受着沈巍舌尖的吸吮，下巴依旧被他捏着不能闭合。 他感受着沈巍的汗水一滴滴落在自己胸口，烫得像火，每一下都让他忍不住想要颤抖，而身下，沈巍的阴茎正在他体内肆意驰骋。 被黑暗放大的感官，让赵云澜清楚地感觉出后穴每一道被撑开的褶皱。 粗大的茎体带着灼热的脉动，一下下擦过他脆弱的内壁，带出酸爽交杂的煎熬。 他大张着腿环上沈巍的腰，身体配合着沈巍的冲撞不断起伏，迎着他每一次的撞击而上，好让他进得更深，又在他每一次后退时，收缩着后穴挽留。 水乳交融的默契逼出了沈巍前所未有的疯狂，他加快了挺动的频率，几乎是发了狠地死命撞，同时不可自控地看向了身下的爱人。 赵云澜正躺在一片深蓝之中，双手紧攥着身下揉皱的床单，身体因着沈巍每一下的撞击不住晃动。 他全身的肌肤已被情欲烧出大片的粉红，胸口小腹还沾着未知的莹白液体，在灯光下泛着艳丽的光。 赵云澜半闭着眼，呻吟从他被吻得红肿的唇瓣间肆意流出，又随着沈巍激烈的撞击，一次次被冲散成了细碎的高亢。 像是感受到了沈巍灼热的目光，他晃动着撑起上身，一双眼睛直直看向沈巍的方向，哑着嗓子断续道：“宝贝......啊......我那里......嗯......是.......是不是......干得.......嗯......很爽？” 如此说着，他缩起后穴就是一夹，激得沈巍受不住地高仰起头，低吼着又是猛力几下撞。 快感堆积得太过汹涌，沈巍皱着眉头压制着射精的欲望，赵云澜却在此时突地一笑，向着他的方向伸出了自己的手。 沈巍眼中紧盯着赵云澜的一举一动，刻意放慢了挺动的速度，慢慢握了上去。 相连处冲撞不停，赵云澜手上用力，扶着沈巍的手坐起了身。 然后他妩媚一笑，将沈巍的食指含进了嘴里，模仿着两人身下交合的频率，用温软的舌头舔弄起来。 十指连心，最是敏感。 指尖被温暖包裹，进出间的粉嫩小舌若隐若现，沈巍看得两眼发直，只觉得全身的热血瞬间涌向了身下，而身下那处容纳自己的湿热甬道像有无数开阖吸吮的小嘴，爽得无可复加。 沈巍的脸叫快感折磨得狰狞起来，他嘶吼一声，将赵云澜的双腿架到肩上，开始了大刀阔斧的最后冲刺。 这样的姿势让后穴的阴茎进得更深，配上沈巍富有技巧的挺动，很快让赵云澜彻底陷入了快感的晕眩，口中浪叫声声不断。 “太棒了......啊......” “对.......就是那里.....” “沈巍.......啊.......真......真他妈爽.......” 爱人的褒奖向来是男人最大的动力。 沈巍伸手将意乱情迷的爱人锁进怀里，更深地向下压进了他的身体。 高潮一瞬，赵云澜舒服得蜷起脚趾，失神间将指尖深深掐进了沈巍的手臂， 沈巍被他下意识收缩的后穴夹得舒爽无比，咬着牙又冲刺一阵，也跟着释放出了精华。 云雨收歇，两人喘息着并排躺在床上。 余韵中，沈巍怔怔看着头顶的灯光，就感觉赵云澜的手摩挲着握了上来。 “是不是没关灯？”他突然问了一句。 沈巍转头细细看了他片刻，反手将他的手收进了掌心，徐徐道：“放心，就算摸黑，你也能满足我。” 赵云澜闻言一愣，随即笑得在床上打了无数个滚，最后滚进了沈巍的怀里。 “你小子可学坏了！”赵云澜的爪子在沈巍的胸口不怀好意地游走了一番，又慢慢往上，最后摸上了沈巍的脸。 有点烫，赵云澜想，这人果然又脸红了。 *~*TEXT*~*
