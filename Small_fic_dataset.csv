G,"""Not to my tastes for myself,"" Emma said, even as she accepted the invitation to inspect the art on the Tattooed Woman's back. ""But I can admire those who take the time to endure the process, and become a canvas of art for posterity."" ""I suppose in your line of work, it would mark you out too much."" ""Indeed."" Emma studied the most recent additions, and what she'd been looking for. ""Thank you, miss. Your latest artist did leave a clue for me in this."" ""Glad to help,"" the woman answered, before pulling her robe on and seeing Emma out."
G,"'You don't strike me as a criminal.' Viktor stated, his tone surprisingly calm and collected for someone who just witnessed their boyfriend order two men to ‘deal with someone.' Jia glanced up from the paperwork on his desk, his magenta coloured eyes meeting the Russian's maroon ones. His face adopted a lazy smile, leaning back in his chair slightly. 'Well,' Jia purred. 'That's what makes me so good at it.' Viktor paused. He inhaled, slightly taken aback at how laidback the Asian was about the whole situation. How calm and lax he was. Like it was all normal. The worst thing, however, was that Viktor knew that Jia was right."

G,"""You idiot!"" Ray shouted as she slapped him, tears starting to form in her eyes. Zack looked shocked. His eyes were wide open, staring at Ray with a concerned look. Ray didn't give a chance for Zack to respond. She continued. ""Why did you go out without me?! You know how the police are these days! Posters of you are everywhere, Zack! Anyone could just spot you walking in an alley and report you to the police!"" ""Why're you so stupid?!"" Ray scolded. ""H-hey Ray..."" Zack walked towards Ray, wrapping his arms around her. Ray sniffled into Zack's hoodie. ""Wh-what.."" ""What am I to do i-if you're not around?"" Ray sobbed. ""How can I take care of myself when you're not here?"" She hugged Zack. ""I-I'm sorry, alright?"" Zack pushed his nose into her golden hair. He put his fingers under her chin and lifted her head up so that she was looking at him. He had to say something to lighten up the mood. He stared into her blue eyes. ""Wanna get something to eat?"" Ray smiled and nodded. ""O-of course"
G,"Angels' chosen to ignore the lack of a collar, bitter as it makes her. They put around her neck a pink ribbon. She's had such before, it's not new. She should feel happy to have it, wag her tail, look cute, but she can't bring herself to. Everyone around her has a collar, older, younger, they all bear it. She does not. These people – Jim dear and Darling. They talk to her like a puppy. Like a child. Like she's some young dog. She hates it, bares teeth at it, then is reminded this is her last shot. Angel doesn't believe a chance will come after this. Angel knows her luck. She can't go back to Buster now, either. She hears talk, people speak of money and coins. She's seen the flat, shiny objects, they mean nothing to her or dogs, but she knows they effect how many things a person can have, dogs included. Still, she feels she should be grateful. But Angel also feels she can't trust these people."
G,"Deltas are women, sisters, daughters, Girls with blackened eyes and split knuckles. Deltas break windows, noses, and hearts, Their teeth are crooked, their jeans are torn. Deltas were all cast aside for another, They belong only to themselves now. Deltas are dirty fingernails and bloody noses, Cigarette ash and whiskey breath. Deltas drifted together and held on tight, They scream at the sky over the roaring ocean. Deltas bury past husbands and lovers, They don't step around, they walk right over you. Deltas glare from the dark with shining eyes, A clowder of cats, a pack of wolves. Deltas come and go as they please Don't ask them where they've been. Deltas are hellions and goblins, they are the moon, They are the color red, they are poisonous flowers. Deltas are women, sisters, daughters, Deltas answer to none."
G,"The red candles burn heavy in the main halls. The wax spills over and burns her hands. It chokes with the sting but it at least it keeps her present. At least it keeps her away from those other times. Keeps her from drowning in the memories. Sneaking to Alex's quarters. Laying her head down in Alex's lap. Alex reading out the latest chapter of her latest shitty romance novel. Alex, when she believed in happy endings. Alex never understood, though. There's only ever been one gift you can give someone you love. And when the time comes- She jumps."
G,"David hadn't made up his mind on what to think of Racer. The other guys seemed to have warmed up to him, but Racer was a mystery. He hoped that would change, but the strike had been over for a couple of weeks and he still was no closer to the blonde. 'I really should go home.' David told Jack, even as he followed the other boy to the Boarding House. 'Nonsense!' Jack replied, 'Stay for a bit. We've all been to yours, but you've been been to where we live.' David didn't bother arguing as Jack pulled him into the building. 'Kelly, you're later than usually,' Mr. Kloppman greeted. Turning his gaze to David, he asked, 'Who's the boy with the big head? He looks like a toothpick with a watermelon on top of it.' Racer, who had been coming down the stairs, burst out laughing. When he noticed the blank looks on Jack and David's face, he asked, 'Are we going to pretend that wasn't funny?' 'Were are you going?' Jack asked as the blonde headed back to the door. 'I'll be back by bell.' was all the younger boy said before closing the door behind him."
G,"Fred and George were leaning against the wall of the parlor in Grimmauld Place, watching as Hermione spoke to Oliver Wood on the other side of the room. She looked amazing, so much lighter than did with the pressure of of school and the war on her. 'I don't get it,' George took a gulp of his fire whiskey, 'two red-headed gods and she picks Oliver Wood. Maybe she feels sorry for him' 'No,' Fred replied as Hermione threw her head back, laughing at whatever the rising Quidditch star had said, 'she doesn't know him the way we do.' 'She looks happy.' George responded, 'Happier than I've ever seen her.' 'Well, she no longer has to get Ronald passing grades.' Fred laughed dryly, 'They look good together.' 'We gotta make sure he doesn't screw this up.' 'That's asking a lot,' Fred grinned, 'Remember the last one?' 'None of his past girls were anywhere close to Hermione's caliber. She's special, unique.' 'Terrifying.' 'Beautiful.' 'Intelligent.' 'Funny.' 'Everything he could want.' Fred nodded, 'Yup, he will definitely need our help.' 'Tomorrow.' George responded, the twins watching as Hermione left the room and Oliver followed right her."
G,"Jack couldn't believe it had come to this. He had never needed relationship advice. Ever. But he had somehow managed to snag a date AND maintain a relationship with Katherine Pulitzer and he had no idea what to get her for Valentine's Day, which is how he ended up at Spot and Racer's apartment. 'Spot once gave me a five-pound box of candy on Valentine's Day anonymously.' Race said, pouring a cup of coffee. 'I never sent you a five-pound box of candy.' Spot's forehead creased in confusion. 'You didn't?' Race turned to face his long-term boyfriend. 'No.' Spot glared at his coffee cup, 'I didn't.' 'Then I must be engaged to the wrong man.' Race smirked, laughing brightly as Spot turned his glare to the blonde. Turning back to Jack, he said, 'As long as it comes from your heart, she'll love it. My favorite gift Spot ever gave was the song that he wrote for me. Just think about it.' Jack was silent for a minute before it dawn on him. He shouted a quick goodbye before he ran out of the apartment."
E,"Loki opened Thor's fly like he was unwrapping a gift. With intoxicating anticipation, Loki freed Thor's cock from the fabric. His fingers explored it, striving to leave no spot untouched. He wrapped his lips around the tip and stroked the shaft. He enjoyed the sensation of Thor's hardness in his hand: the firmness of the flesh and the hot, silky skin… Thor grabbed Loki's head and began to thrust wildly into his mouth. Soon Loki felt the gush of Thor's come and he hurried to swallow, relishing the complex taste and the smooth feel of it sliding down his throat."
E,"Eve whimpers. Villanelle's fingers curl inside of her. She meets her lover's blackened eyes. 'More, please,' Eve begs. Villanelle obliges and adds a third finger inside. Eve is close. So so close. She wraps her arms around Villanelle's neck, pulling her in for a kiss. 'Fuck,' she groans. 'Please daddy.' Villanelle freezes. Eve whimpers. Seconds later, her eyes go wide as realization hits. 'I didn't, I mean-' 'Say it again,' Villanelle orders. Eve is confused. Villanelle starts to move her fingers again at an agonizingly slow pace. 'Say it again.' Eve shudders as Villanelle's fingers pick up speed. 'Oh fuck daddy,' she moans. She's close, she can feel the heat rising, and Villanelle only speeds up. 'Again.' Villanelle curls her fingers. Eve tenses up. She clenches her eyes shut as she orgasms. 'Yes, yes oh fuck yes daddy,' she whispers as she falls over the edge."
E,"The demon whined dramatically, grinding against Froze roughly. ""Fruuoooooooze, I'm horny!! I wanna fuuuuck!!"" She ground against the angel more, moaning softly as she teased the angel through her panties. The angel offered no response but to raise her waist a little higher, giving Yosafire free access to her. The demon grinned, excitedly pulling down Froze's panties before grinding against her roughly, before pushing inside roughly, taking the angel as she read. She offered no real response, though her breathing became slightly more ragged as the demon began to pound her out. Yosaf's tail thrashed, and she moaned loudly, ravaging the angel with all she had, moaning and panting, clutching her as she took her, Froze's lack of reaction only spurring her on more, causing her moans to grow louder. The angel turned her page, and Yosafire fucked her harder, her tail coiling around her own leg as she grew close, her cock throbbing before she pumped Froze full of cum, sighing happily as she pulled out. The angel sighed, and gently pulled up her panties, sitting down with shaky legs. That had taken more out of her than she'd expected."
E,"Prompts for the Queen of Queen Smut Mrs annieapple24 . 1.

E,"Do they know I call you Daddy? While you're playing cards in the pub, while you're working underneath cars, do they realise how you make me moan that title as you whip and bruise me, marking me yours? They see a best mate, a colleague like any other, they don't know how you make me beg for relief as you bring me to orgasm after constant orgasm. You hold the leash, the whip, my neck. But they don't know that. They don't realise you're my Daddy, my owner, and I'm your submissive little cumslut, who'll slave over your cock for a precious prize. They see an old man at heart and his young, ambitious love. They're not wrong."
E,"His cock rams into me in one powerful thrust, splitting me open from below and all the way to the limit of my cervix. My back shags weakly still until I'm lying flushed against his strong chest, moaning and sweating profusely, his thick arms wrapped around my slender waist to hold me still as he continues to fuck into my tight channel mercilessly, powerful and precise, the fresh blood trickling down my pussy and onto his throbbing cock becoming the only source of lubrication that can help ease my burden. I am trapped with nowhere to run, my pussy throbbing in pain, clamped down around his thick, pulsating hardness, the beat matching my estranged heartbeat."
E,"There are words, words he should say, but as he looks up into Sherlock's face, eyes nearly closed, the ridiculously posh lips parted as he moves slowly above him, he knows anything he could say wouldn't be enough, not nearly enough, so he laughs, then covers his mouth with both hands as Sherlock glares down at him, but the lips quirk up in understanding. As he well knows, the laughter is a symptom of joy, not of derision, and he leans closer and kisses him lightly, then whispers, ""happy anniversary, John."" There is nothing more to be said as John's arms wrap around him tightly as he buries his face into John's neck and breathes him in, their separate scents have long fused together, though he can still remember, as he always remembers everything; a time before, a time before John, a time before he was loved, before he found he was capable of returning the love. John's arms tighten around him as he sobs, fingers lightly trace over the old scars and as he finally finds his voice whispers back, ""happy anniversary, love."""
E,"It takes a surprisingly long time to get from the balcony to the bed, from kissing to what comes next. 'Cain,' Lucifer whines, when Pierce bears down on him. 'Cain.' 'Samael,' Pierce counters, and Lucifer wails, wings unfolding from his back. Afterward, under the blanket of feathers, Lucifer speaks softly, in the rounded, heavy language of the time before Babel. What do you desire? Cain answers, sharp and tight-jawed. To die. 'That's a different dialect,' Lucifer derails, in English again. 'Where were you living, then? Sounds Eastern.' 'Do you ever shut up?' Pierce growls, shoving Lucifer into the mattress again."
E,"From their heart-shaped tub, Stiles watched his naked husband stalk around dimming lights, the perfect way to spend their honeymoon. No. Wait. Not perfect. 'D'erk,' Stiles slurred. 'Ya need t' get in. Think I'm stuck in a ventricle.' Hopping gracefully into the tub, 'How much champagne have you drunk?' Derek asked. ' Lots . Kiss me now.' Derek kissed him. 'You taste like Veuve Clicquot .' Stiles sighed. 'You're so smart. Married you ‘cause you're so smart, ya know.' 'I know.' After another kiss, 'An' ‘cause you got a great ass and bomb dick.' 'I know, Stiles. You said that in your vows.'"
E,"Pressing himself against Derek's chest, Stiles felt sweat between them, and something like a baseball in his rectum. (Being the analytical type, he liked precise comparisons.) After his third orgasm he also felt a bit detached, mentally at least, from the proceedings. Derek, non-verbal, managed only grunts, exhalations both sudden and slow. Stiles reached behind, nesting his fingers in Derek's sweaty hair. 'So if I conjure up a knot on my dick, then I can knot you?' he asked. A deep, drawn out, ' Mmmm ,' meant Derek had either climaxed again or else he was agreeing. Stiles decided Derek was agreeing."
G,"Casey looks at Kevin with a jaunty smile. She turns on the stereo, she puts on some music and she comes back to him, but she approaches him with caution as if she doesn't really want to scare him in any way. ""Would you like to dance with me?"" she asks him, ""please"" she grabs his hands by dancing awkwardly together until she does a pirouette on herself. Kevin and Casey's laughs echo in their home. ""Hold me"" Casey whispers softly to Kevin, then she leads him by guiding his hands on her hips. She puts her head against his chest. It's like being in a dream. Their scars don't hurt anymore. All is well."
G,"Everyone gathered in the practice room for a group photo with Youngjae holding his birthday cake. After a couple pictures, he blew out the candles, and everyone clapped. Now it was gift opening time!  No doubt he got quite a haul from TRCNG being 10 boys and all, and of course 7 from SONAMOO. And there should be 5 from his B.A.P brothers---wait, there only appears to be 4?  “Hey! Daehyun!”   “What?” he replied, munching on some chicken.   Youngjae pointed at the pile of gifts.  “Oh!” Daehyun handed him the rest of his chicken. “I’ll share this once.”"
G,"Finally.     Humans and Monsters living on the surface together in peace and harmony.     After years of hard work as the Ambassador of Monsters, Frisk can finally rest in peace.     ‘Looks like this is the end, huh partner?’, a familiar voice is heard in their head.     ‘I suppose it is Chara…’, they respond in their head, while laying in their deathbed surrounded by family and friends, mixture of Monster and Humans.     ‘Well you are  old  after all.’     ‘Chara, are you forgetting the fact that you’re much  older  than me?’, Frisk asked amusingly.     ‘I’m a dead 10 year old, Frisk.’     ‘Does not change the fact that you’re  older  than me’     They couldn’t help but feel nostalgic having this banter with the voice inside their head.     When they stop bantering, Frisk could feel their body weakening than before.     ‘It looks like I’m going away soon…’     ‘Yeah… our time is almost up.’     ‘Chara, I hope in our next life we could meet again…’     ‘Me too, Frisk…’     ‘Love you Chara…’, the last thought in their head.     ‘… Love you too Frisk.’     A Newborn’s wailing can be heard."
G,"The mission had gone sideways from the moment he and Tony had touched down. The Hydra base they’d come to investigate was supposed to be abandoned. It was a cut and dry data retrieval mission, Tony just seeing what he could get off their computers. Steve had only tagged along because he had nothing better to do.  Instead, they’d been met by an ambush. Their coms had been scrambled and Tony’s suit taken out with what Steve was pretty sure had been an anti-aircraft missile. Steve had grabbed his unresponsive teammate and dragged him as far out as he could, but it wasn’t far enough. Hydra had still caught up with them before Steve could get them back to the quinjet.  “Move aside, Captain,” the lightly-accented voice instructed with smug glee. “It’s over.”  Steve all but snarled at the man, not moving from his place in front of Tony’s crumpled form. This bastard could fuck off right to hell.  “Why don’t you make me?”"
G,"It's not a very noticeable place, Thousands of places are just like this; A street full of non-discrete houses With homes full of non-discrete people.  People from all walks of life settle down here, All with stories to tell, some of them just beginning. But it matters not to me, I do not know them well. Our houses so close together yet so far apart, Walls of brick and business between us. We have no time for neighbors.  Only the changing leaves show a passing of time. So caught up in our never-changing lives. I do not blame them, I am the same.  The best way to describe my home is: ordinary. Like me, with billions of others like me. But it is what it is, It's home."
G,"Edith had always been an admirer of Virginia Woolf, so when she had the chance to go to Charleston to meet the Bloomsbury group, Edith was delighted.   In person, the Bloomsbury set were a marvel, Edith was overwhelmed, surrounded by her heroes, writers, painters and creatives and Virginia had been everything that Edith hoped for and more, the way she spoke with such passion, her effortless confidence and the way she looked at Edith as if she were the only person in the room. Edith was in awe of her."
G,"That morning, Saten-san barged into the judgement headquarters that the four found themselves converging every day.  “Guess what guys, I enrolled in a kendo class!”  Misaka gulped audibly.  “Now I’m going to fight with Misaka-san and Shirai-san!” She cheered miming sword motions.  Misaka didn’t think her encouragement would spur her into putting herself into such danger, but she didn’t have the heart to disagree with her after having heard the thoughts of all the level 0’s in academy city.  Kuroko began to speak, “Saten-san that is far too dangerous for you and I can no-“  Misaka began to put her hands over Kuroko’s mouth.  “Th- that’s amazing Saten-san I look forward to it!”. Misaka managed to choke out.  Saten beamed. "
G,"The sun was setting.  Jongup was going to an office to meet up with his Triple Nine friends. With his hands stuffed in the pockets of his hoodie, he noticed his shadow casted upon the wall. Usually he thought nothing of it, but he watched as the silhouetted reflection mimic’d every move he’d make.  He jumped, it jumped. Spin around, an in-sync copy. There was no way escaping your shadow. As long as light shined, it would hide behind you. But that also meant--  “Jongup-hyung!” Junhong called.  “What took you so long?” Yoonsun asked.  “I was dancing with my shadow.”"
G,"Another day, another headache. I long for these days to be over, they consume me; the days of being bedridden with my head pounding with waves of unbearable pain, unable to remember my past. The days of having my every need taken care of when others need it far more... I’ve spent long enough in a bed, I have done my fair share of sleeping, of being taken care of. It’s time for me to wake up and move past the world that has consumed my life... And yet, it is the world of my dreams that lead me to what I believe to be my hope, my only chance at finding out the truth of Lucio.  A small magic shop, sitting in town, it calls to me. While this was the first time I have seen it, my gut tells me that is my next destination.  As soon as my headache begins to clear, I swiftly throw on my cowl and exit my room."
G,"Bertie stared agape at his valet, who'd gone distinctly pink around the ear and cheek region, before said valet biffed off in the direction of the kitchen, presumably to lick his wounded pride. The last of the Woosters simply couldn't believe what his own eyes and ears had told him-that the reason why Jeeves seemed to make himself scarce when crooning was called for, was because the man quite simply, could not carry a tune in a bucket, nor even a wheelbarrow. He couldn't keep a pitch if he had a team of groundskeepers. Quite simply, the velvety voice that was apt to make one go gooey around the middle when speaking could not sing. It took a full minute before Bertie could pick his jaw up from the floor, and another to realize that perhaps apologies should be in order-after all, he'd cajoled Jeeves into singing along with him, despite numerous protests. Looking forlornly at the paisley print tie around his neck, he removed it with some sadness, deciding that it was the least he could do."
E,"“Potter,” Draco spits the name out, and gives the other boy a dirty look when they meet in the hallways. “Potter,” he whispers to himself, as a dirty little secret when he’s alone. “Potter,” he moans quietly at night, stiff prick in his hand, his mind filled with dirty desires. “Potter,” Draco whimpers, afraid for his life, hiding for the dirty deeds that are done in his house.  Potter, he thinks, but he tells his aunt that he can not be sure, her dirty breath filling his nostrils.  “Potter,” he gasps, when he sees the lifeless body with the dirty face, his heart painfully aching in despair. “Potter,” he says stiffly when the man shows up to his house, bringing back the wand he stole from him with his dirty hands. “Potter,” he sighs, and forgiveness was always a dirty word until now. Now it is offered to him. “Potter?” Draco asks in disbelief when an embrace washes everything that once was dirty away. “Harry,” He smiles, and the sun is warm and bright when he takes his hand."
E,"Sherlock's a tease, shilly-shally He made John wait Now it's John's turn, shilly-shally To retaliate  John's in no rush, shilly-shally He'll take it slow Sherlock just wants, shilly-shally To fuck his dildo   John strokes his thigh, shilly-shally And kisses his lips Sherlock cries out, shilly-shally And bucks his hips   Sherlock’s so close, shilly-shally His hands clench to fists John gives a smirk, shilly-shally And binds his wrists  John takes his time, shilly-shally Strokes his cock slow He wants to play, shilly-shally Won’t let Sherlock blow  Until at last, shilly-shally John kisses his bum Sticks his tongue in, shilly-shally And lets him come "
E,"Richie? Yeah? I think I'm a little high. Well that's good I guess it worked. Richie? Yeah? I really liked having your mouth so close to mine. Me too. Richie ? Yeah Eddie ... I think I'm a little high... You already said that... Eddie rolls slightly sideways puts his hand on Richie's chest and looks down at him... Richie? Yeah? Can I...can I put my mouth next to yours again? Yeah, sure, Eds. Eddie leans in looking at Richie's lips, then his eyes then back at his mouth again. Then he very very gently places a mostly bottom lip kiss on his mouth. Richie brings his right arm around to put on to Eddie's hip. Richie? Yeah? Is this okay? Yeah Eddie this is great. Can we do this when we're not high sometime you think? Yeah that'd be awesome. Eddie? Yeah? I'm going to grab your ass now. Awesome. Eddie rolls forward so that his hip bone is locked on top of Richie's and his left leg slides in between Richie's legs. Richie? Yeah Eddie...  This is the best I've ever felt my whole life... Hey Ed's... Me too."
E,"""Shiro wait, before we have sex I have a confession to make,"" Keith said. ""I lost my virginity to Towelie."" ""Me too,"" said Shiro. ""Me three,"" said Pidge. ""Yeah, I might've messed around with him back at the Garrison,"" said Hunk. ""And on Altea, I had a secret affair with him until Father found out and kicked him out of the palace for being high all the time,"" Allura added. Lance burst into tears. ""WHY, TOWELIE?!"" he sobbed. ""You said I was special!"" ""Don't forget to fuck a towel!"" said Towelie. Then Sparky ran in and grabbed Towelie in his mouth and jerked off with him. ""Wow, that towel's a slut,"" said Pidge. ""Let's get high."" So everyone got high and Keith and Shiro didn't get to fuck until later that night. "
E,"He is warm and present.    So warm she is melting alive, rooted to the spot, struck by the lightning of him.  The heat of his skin seems to sear her as he pulls her tight to his chest.  His mouth is an open wound, mumbling curses that feel like reassurances.  Her teeth are white and dig like ploughshares as they bite into his shoulder and his fingers find the readiness of her.    They come together frantically, with rain pounding against the roof.  The orgasms are all throbbing hearts and scraping nails.  Let them be damned together.  Let them be saved."
E,"It’s her despair that orchestrates the killing game, so she figures it’s okay to meet Celestia in the courtroom long after the other students have left.  After all, it’s her lips that press against perfectly painted red, smears the lipstick there and pulls a soft sound from Celestia’s throat.  It’s her nails that drag up unblemished milky skin and leave angry red lines there.  It’s her thumb that presses into Celestia’s clit and pushes her closer, closer, until she orgasms with a shaky cry and raises her hips from the bed.  It’s  her  and nobody else that can love Celestia. "
E,"(I don’t know Russian, so hopefully the translation site I used didn’t give me nonsense…)  Caption Translation: &lt;“So good for me…perfect, sweetheart…”&gt;   “Fuck,” Steve groaned, trying to push back even further and struggling against the iron grip that pressed him down. He  needed  Bucky closer, needed to feel him. “Keep going.” Needed him to keep talking. Bucky started talking again, his voice a low rumbling rush of accented words which were punctuated by each roll of his hips. Steve only understood about one word in ten but he didn’t even need to know what filth Bucky was crooning at him to know every delicious syllable that ran off Bucky’s tongue went straight to his cock. And god did he love it. "

E,"The position they were in wasn’t exactly comfortable for Tom. He was bound to have back pain and knee pain and shoulder pain and well everywhere pain the next day. This was not angle a human person was meant to stay in for long.  However, he knew he could bare it if only because Dickie seemed to be enjoying himself. That alone made it enjoyable for Tom.  Tom had imagined their first time to be different. Sure he wasn’t expecting rose petals but he still thought different. It would have been different if Dickie hadn’t caught Tom going through his closet. The look on Dickie’s face, a look of absolute disgust, would probably stay with him forever even though he only had to see it for a few seconds before Dickie knocked him onto the ground.  Dickie thrust a little too hard and Tom squirmed, “Please.”  “Jesus, you want it bad. Probably all you think about,” He looked down at him, “You’re so fucking pathetic.”  Dickie didn’t laugh as he said that. He didn’t even crack a smile. Tom wasn’t sure if that made it hurt more or less."
E,"while you quietly savour the soothing moment in the tub, putting your head on his shoulder. It feels so good that you nearly fall asleep, but then you feel his finger circle around your belly button.  ""Hmm... I like that.""  ""How about this?""  Richard asks with a dirty smirk on his face, taking your earlobe between his lips. His fingers trace up and down your side before he slips them into your inner thigh.  You try to tell him to stop but he puts his other hand over your mouth and says,  ""I won't stop until you arch your back and scream my name."""
G,"“Weak American ghost, ptah!” Zoya spits in defiance of the inexplicable footsteps that plod down the dark hallway. “Western cholesterol has made you slow and insubstantial, unlike strong - “ she pats her stomach, demonstrative and obstinate. “Soviet borscht!”  Liberty Belle leans conspiratorially in to the camera and crosses her fingers, “Well, our audience is mostly good American boys and girls, so we’re cheering for that blessed little ghost from the heart of Louisiana, aren’t we?”  The footsteps suddenly speed up, and she bounces and cheers as Zoya squares up.  “Go get her, ghost! Red, white, and boo your little heart out!”"
G,"When the furious sky cheered, the dark-haired girl shrank even more in the corner of the room, shrieking trembling, feeling her body strongly restless and a sorrow in her hypothetical heart. She was feeling bad. She felt bad for not being able to overcome her fear and go to rehearse with others even when they discovered they couldn't hurt them.  And falling prey to her panic, he didn't hear the door open slowly, followed by the sound of steps that apparently wanted to go unnoticed. She was scared, nervous, and that feeling increased when someone hugged her with clinging.  ""Don't worry, everything's fine."" Saki's naturally aggressive voice sounded gentle and anguished, surprising Ai who let out a few tears. In turn, her fingers were tangled between her hairs, making her almost assure that it was someone else; but she remembered that the biker was the only one who knew the cause of her death. “Don't you want to accompany us?” In response, she denied forcefully. “It's okay, I'll be with you. The girls will be fine without us...” "
G,"Laurus Nobilis       The night I saw your eyes  I saw the bottom of the Mediterranean sea  And trapped under the cool blue   A burning, glistening jade  You do not fear the cascade     The day I saw your smile  I saw our talks, how they would run for miles  Meaningful moments full of meaningless words  Drift till one of us goes unheard  You do not ignore the absurd     The time I saw your hand  I saw the laurel of bay around our heads  Long, coarse, and victorious - you are the evergreen  Step down from the display  You do not give in to the sway     And I pray that you stay that way - pantotiná."
G,"When there's snow, I come out of my den, high up in the mountains. A blizzard again. Perfect. No one would see me.  Up I fly. Up and up and up. Until I pass the clouds and burst through their icy layer. It is cold up here too, but I thrive in the extreme temperature of the snow called mountains. Such a small change wouldn't harm me.  Deciding to see the world below, I dip through the clouds, watching snow fade into the grass, and then the forests in the valleys.   And as I pass over this world, I become just a dragon in the sky."
G,In the winter My window freezes The one in the highest part of my room  Where my curtains don’t reach Far above my bed.   I do not fear the cold  Instead I mourn the loss of my lovers face  If I peel back the velvet Early into the winter morning  There is a chance I will see her.   Usually I fall asleep  Lost among endless pages  Intertwined with my blankets  And poked by my pencils  Missing her lovely gaze.   But not tonight  After this years first snow fall I will wait with the sheets of ice That snuck into my room To see her dressed in red And kiss her goodnight.
G,"             Steven's other half, his light that had left his body, stared blankly at its host. Not saying a word; it picked the now  completely  human child into its arms. It's expression changed there, now it was no longer blank and unfeeling. It was full of sorrow, crying like he was. Steven's sorrow turned into joy-- hope for the future --as his arms wrapped around its neck. The sorrowful light looked confused at the boy's laughter, but it soon starting laughing itself, there was no sadness or worry there. There was only happiness. The boy who questioned his identity for the last fourteen years finally felt free. Because he was him. There was no  her  to be found. The light that shined for his mother once understood. Its host was now... will always be... at peace. With himself, with the mother who'd birthed him. Two beings became one again; the simple half-gem child named Steven Universe. Tears that fell afterwards, they still were only out of joy."
G,"He wonders what his new people see when they look at him from afar. Do they see only the stranger, the half breed abomination that their Queen gave life to from the surface world that attempts to be a king to them?  Or do they see an Ocean Master turned King, who commands the loyalty of all sea beasts?  For his part, Arthur tries to make himself appear to be less of a bumbling, hulking creature whom they laugh at behind his back and works hard to learn their ways with the help of Mera, his Mother, and Vulko even while tending to the responsibilities that he has on land."
G,Pig started his story again   Where there was a beautiful princess who used to cry day and night nobody knows way  Her tears where rad like blood  Her eyes were rad  Her mouth were round   Her hands used to shake while prying  She used to sing songs  And the animals of the forest were her friend  The princess were lonely very much     She used to stay in her room all of her life  Never come out once   Only servants saw how beautiful she was  They were jealous of her beauty   But sad too of her sadness  The crying princess never got married  Nobody come to save him  No Prince of her dream come  That's how her life goes on
G,Mom saw my face it was cold  I know her hand was tumbling   But still she hold me close to her chest  Where i knew i would be save     I died when i was really young maybe two and half year old  I have dark skin tone  But i don't care  Maybe because i am too small too care  I find myself beautiful like a princess  Waiting for her Prince     I can see when i grow up having a future but death always comes first  Mom my poor mom waiting for me at the door  Aren't caring about what people are saying   I know and i believe she will save me  She keeps waiting     Every life i am getting a new mother  All of them love me the same  Mother's love never change  But i am scared for him  What he will do to me   I am in a hole and there is fire and Mudd in me   And i am suffocating   I need air   I hold my trout  I don't feel pain from the fire  It just that my heart is breaking  Dying every time  Death is the path i can't refuse 
G,"She has her own special way Of turning around my terrible day. She makes all the bad things go away The second that she says hey. And when I look into her eyes, I see pure beauty with no disguise. Just a glance at her makes my heartbeat rise. I know for a fact that these feelings aren't lies. If only she knew How much my love for her grew, Maybe, just maybe, we could start something new, And then I'd never feel blue. And if beauty were inches, she'd go on for miles. I'd better catch her before I go out of style. I'm going to let my heart be my dial So I can tell her what I've been feeling for a while"
E,"Nico was fucking him. Jason lay on his back, enjoying Nico’s considerable length inside him. He’d tried to sit up for a kiss, only to be pushed back down with force and one word: “down.” Jason had readily obeyed. He had his arms above his head, pinned down by Nico’s hand. Nico was fucking him  hard . Jason marveled at the powerful thrusts that Nico’s slight frame was capable of. He admired Nico’s intense, focused expression. Nico, who in another life he’d thought of as breakable, was completely in control of him. Jason couldn’t stop moaning. Nico couldn’t stop fucking him."
E,"She’s looking into your eyes. It’s a neon fire and it causes you to scream- “iM gAYYYY” Yes the story of how my best friend turned gay from KDA league of legends. Kai Sa stands tall and proud in a dimly lit tunnel. Two strong and glowing waves speed by her- “MY HORMONES HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED AHHHHGHGGGSHAHAHAH” Yes, the beloved Iwachans hormones now explode with as much colour as the beams. Slight kick to the rusty washing machine. Ahri opens her tired but experienced eyes. It been half a decade, she’s earned the look, alphaness shines  clear. She waits impatiently as her clothes wash- “GORGEOUSGORGEOUSGORGEOUSAHHHH” THE CURVE OOF  OOOF LOOK THOSE HIPS AND LEGA OOF SO GOOD yes it is eve that appears. "
E,"Mettaton EX step s  on you in high boots with high heels, forcing you to submit to him and worship his legs.  ""You're getting off to it, aren't you?"" he asks softly as he presses the heel into your skin. ""Disgusting,"" he sighs almost dreamily. ""You're the worst creature I've ever met.""  Afterwards he sits down in an armchair and crosses his legs. ""Come on, darling,"" he says in an almost loving tone as he pulls at the long pink leash attached to the collar on your neck, forcing you to crawl towards him. He rests his chin on his free hand, looking down at you lazily and obviously bored. ""Entertain me, pet."" He nearly shoves his foot into your face. ""Lick it clean.""  After you're done cleaning his high boots, you're rewarded. Mettaton sits on your face and lets you pleasure him until he comes all over your face, cooing about how  good  of a pet you are.  And you do feel like you've done a pretty great job. "
E,"""Sigurd come to my castle for a nice hot cup of coffee"" Arvis said. ""It's the gourmet kind not the instant freeze dried garbage you feed your army.""  ""I do miss good coffee"" said Sigurd. So he came over and Arvis poured him a steaming mug of hot amazing coffee...but there was a secret ingredient in it.  ""I heard you like your coffee with CREAM in it"" said Arvis.  ""Is that why you jacked off into the mug?"" Sigurd asked. ""That's right, I know. It just so happens that I drink my coffee with semen in it all the time!"" Arvis gasped.  ""This is even more shocking than when I learned your-MY wife has a period oral fetish!""  ""What you're not into it? it's hot,"" said Sigurd. Arvis got mad.  ""Atone for your sins by sucking my thick meaty cock while your wife watches!""  so he did and Deirdre got off on it. Then they both fucked her cause having hot sex is better than committing genocide."
E,"Kenny was sick of being immortal so he used a curse to make other people immortal so he wouldn't have to suffer alone. butters volunteered cause they're boyfriends while Cartman did cause he wants to be rich and powerful.

E,"Izuku lied on the bed, watching Katsuki grab his jacket and leave the dorm. The boy was aching, his body felt weak and all he wanted to do was sleep for the entire day. Two am. It was two am when Izuku got the courage to get up from his bed and wipe the dry cum off of his face and shower before resting. This happened almost every night since they got dorms. Izuku was glad that the two made up, but when Katsuki started dating Eijirou, the two still fucked around. It confused Izuku. A lot.  It always happened around eight pm as well. Izuku regrets it all.   ""Stay this time,"" Izuku reached out to the blonde who just shook his head. ""Please.""   ""You know I can't. I won't."" Katsuki pulled away from Izuku's grip, leaving him the same way he was before. Broken, a mess, confused, sad. "
E,"""I never whack off in bed. I THINK IT'S DEPRAVED!"" yelled Beavis who was stoned, cause when he gets stoned he acts all dignified. Butthead tried to smack him but the weed slowed him down and he landed facedown in a bowl of chips  ""huhuhuhuhuh that was cool"" he said and ate the chips like a dog eating dog food.  ""You guys you shouldn't get stoned in my house my parents are gonna get mad also you left the fridge open and one of you peed in the oevn"" whined Stewart but he's a dumb fat kid so no one cares about him anyway.  then a bunch of naked chicks came in and Beavis and Butthead finally scored all over the living room.  and then they woke up from their coma dream brought on by smoking too much weed "
E,"Their lovemaking is frantic tonight. It jolts them alive, makes them forget the fear of almost losing each other earlier.     Rey whimpers deliciously with Ben’s quick, well-placed thrusts. Fucking Rey is like fighting her. He has to be precise, match her rhythm and be extra bold to make her  beg .      “Ask nicely, sweetheart, and I’ll let you come.” Even Ben’s husky voice trembles. He loves taking her from behind, how she grasps at the sheets, how her legs shake, willing.     “Please!  Ben .” It’s all Ben needs to go deeper, faster. She’ll reach her peak in seconds, and he’ll follow, always."
E,"Roger the alien was a giant douche who got drunk and killed people all the time and the Smiths were tired of cleaning up all his messes. Blood's a bitch to get out of stuff and he was stealin all their booze.  ""Roger we're sending you to alien boarding school"" Francine said, she'd made the decision herself cause Stan was too busy being a kiss-ass to his boss and a lousy husband. Roger bitched and moaned and tried to make them drink drain cleaner but when he got to the boarding school there were hot schoolgirls in sexy uniforms and schoolboys walking around without their shirts on  ""I'M STAYING FOREVER"" he said and since the staff was crap he got away with all kinds of shit. The moral of the story is the alien always wins."
E,Stan and Kyle got stoned one day when they were 15 and fucked all over Kyle's house cause pot made them horny. Wendy came in and caught them and started getting mad till she remembered she was fucking Heidi and Bebe anyway so she went off to bang them under a bridge. What under a bridge is totally a fine place to bang.  Kyles mom came home to find cum all over the couch and got mad cause cum is a bitch to clean up so she bought a new couch but Kyle had to give up his allowance for a month to pay for it and put a slipcover on. Which was fine considering she coulda done worse like blown up Canada or something.  Stan also learned that his dad's new pot farm was good for one thing cause he was stealing his dad's pot.
